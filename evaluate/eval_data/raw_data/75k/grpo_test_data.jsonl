The system has a configuration with two parameters: `saveToFS`, a boolean indicating whether to save data to the file system, and `maxCacheSize`, an integer representing the maximum size of the cache.\n\nYou need to create a class `StorageCache` that manages the caching mechanism. The class should have the following methods:\n\n1. `StorageCache(boolean saveToFS, int maxCacheSize)`: A constructor that initializes the `saveToFS` and `maxCacheSize` parameters.\n\n2. `String saveStorage(Update update, Storage storage) throws IOException`: A method that saves the `update` to the cache or file system based on the `saveToFS` configuration. If the cache size exceeds `maxCacheSize`, the least recently used item should be evicted from the cache.\n\n3. `String getStorageIdentifierByUUID(String uuid)`: A method that generates a storage identifier based on the given UUID.\n\nYou should implement the caching mechanism and ensure that the `saveStorage` method behaves according to the specified requirements.", "response": "```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.LinkedHashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.util.UUID;\n\npublic class StorageCache {\n    private final boolean saveToFS;\n    private final int maxCacheSize;\n    private Map<String, Update> cache;\n\n    public StorageCache(boolean saveToFS, int maxCacheSize) {\n        this.saveToFS = saveToFS;\n        this.maxCacheSize = maxCacheSize;\n        this.cache = new LinkedHashMap<>(maxCacheSize, 0.75f, true) {\n            @Override\n            protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<String, Update> eldest) {\n                return size() > maxCacheSize;\n            }\n        };\n    }\n\n    public String saveStorage(Update update, Storage storage) throws IOException {\n        String storageIdentifier = getStorageIdentifierByUUID(UUID.randomUUID().toString().substring(0, 8));\n        if (saveToFS) {\n            // Save to file system\n            storage.saveToFS(storageIdentifier, update);\n        } else {\n            // Save to cache\n            cache.put(storageIdentifier, update);\n        }\n        return storageIdentifier;\n    }\n\n    public String getStorageIdentifierByUUID(String uuid) {\n        // Generate storage identifier based on UUID\n        return \"ST-\" + uuid;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the solution, the `StorageCache` class is implemented with a constructor to initialize the `saveToFS` and `maxCacheSize` parameters. The `saveStorage` method saves the update to the cache or file system based on the `saveToFS` configuration and evicts the least recently used item if the cache size exceeds `maxCacheSize`. The `getStorageIdentifierByUUID` method generates a storage identifier based on the given UUID."}
