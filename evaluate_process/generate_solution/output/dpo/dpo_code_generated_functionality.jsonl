The snippet includes a loop that iterates through a list of pages and calculates the usage of a specific resource based on a quota key. It then calculates the percentage of usage relative to a given value and checks if it exceeds a requested threshold. If the usage exceeds the threshold, it creates a resource object with a specific digest.\n\nYour task is to implement a function that takes in the necessary data and performs the resource analysis based on the given logic.\n\nWrite a function `analyze_resource_usage(pages, quota_data, value, threshold_requested)` that takes in the following parameters:\n- `pages`: A list of pages, where each page is a dictionary containing resource usage data.\n- `quota_data`: A dictionary containing the quota key used to calculate resource usage.\n- `value`: A numerical value used to calculate the percentage of resource usage.\n- `threshold_requested`: A numerical value representing the threshold for resource usage percentage.\n\nThe function should analyze the resource usage based on the given logic and return a list of resource objects that have exceeded the specified threshold. Each resource object should have a digest containing the quota code and type.\n\nExample:\n```python\nquota_data = {\"key\": \"storage_usage\"}\npages = [\n    {\"storage_usage\": [100, 200, 300]},\n    {\"storage_usage\": [150, 250, 350]},\n    {\"storage_usage\": [120, 220, 320]},\n]\nvalue = 1000\nthreshold_requested = 70\n\nprint(analyze_resource_usage(pages, quota_data, value, threshold_requested))\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[Resource(digest=ResourceDigest(id='quota_code', type='aws_limit'))]\n```", "response": "\n\n```python\nclass ResourceDigest:\n    def __init__(self, id, type):\n        self.id = id\n        self.type = type\n\nclass Resource:\n    def __init__(self, digest):\n        self.digest = digest\n\ndef analyze_resource_usage(pages, quota_data, value, threshold_requested):\n    overused_resources = []\n    quota_key = quota_data[\"key\"]\n    quota_code = \"quota_code\"  # Replace with actual quota code retrieval logic\n\n    for page in pages:\n        usage = sum(page.get(quota_key, [])) / len(page.get(quota_key, []))\n        percentage = (usage / value) * 100\n        if percentage > threshold_requested:\n            resource_digest = ResourceDigest(id=quota_code, type=\"aws_limit\")\n            overused_resource = Resource(resource_digest)\n            overused_resources.append(overused_resource)\n\n    return overused_resources\n```"}

It should provide users with relevant and engaging content, and allow advertisers to target their ads effectively. The platform should also be easy to navigate and offer tracking features for ad performance.\n\n## Requirement Pool\n```python\n[\n    (\"Develop a content recommendation algorithm based on user interests\", \"P0\"),\n    (\"Build a user-friendly interface for easy navigation\", \"P0\"),\n    (\"Create a native advertising system for targeted ads\", \"P0\"),\n    (\"Implement ad performance tracking features\", \"P1\"),\n    (\"Ensure the platform supports high-quality content\", \"P2\")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft\nThe platform should have a clean and intuitive design. The homepage should feature a feed of recommended content based on the user's interests. There should be clear sections for different categories of content. For advertisers, there should be a separate dashboard where they can create, manage, and track their ads.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nThe system will be designed as a web application using Django, a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. For the content recommendation algorithm, we will use Scikit-learn, a machine learning library in Python. It will be used to analyze user interests and provide relevant content. For the native advertising system, we will use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. For the user interface, we will use Bootstrap, a free and open-source CSS framework. For database, we will use PostgreSQL, a powerful, open source object-relational database system. \n\n## Python package name\n```python\n\"content_discovery_platform\"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    \"manage.py\",\n    \"content_discovery_platform/settings.py\",\n    \"content_discovery_platform/urls.py\",\n    \"content_discovery_platform/wsgi.py\",\n    \"users/models.py\",\n    \"users/views.py\",\n    \"users/urls.py\",\n    \"content/models.py\",\n    \"content/views.py\",\n    \"content/urls.py\",\n    \"ads/models.py\",\n    \"ads/views.py\",\n    \"ads/urls.py\",\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class User{\n        +str username\n        +str email\n        +str password\n        +list interests\n        +__init__(username: str, email: str, password: str, interests: list)\n    }\n    class Content{\n        +str title\n        +str description\n        +list category\n        +User creator\n        +__init__(title: str, description: str, category: list, creator: User)\n    }\n    class Ad{\n        +str title\n        +str description\n        +list target_audience\n        +User advertiser\n        +__init__(title: str, description: str, target_audience: list, advertiser: User)\n    }\n    User \"1\" -- \"*\" Content: creates\n    User \"1\" -- \"*\" Ad: creates\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant C as Content\n    participant A as Ad\n    U->>C: create content\n    C->>U: return content id\n    U->>A: create ad\n    A->>U: return ad id\n    U->>C: view content\n    C->>U: return content\n    U->>A: view ad\n    A->>U: return ad\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirement is clear to me., Project Manager: ##

{"index": 4682, "prompt": "I know that `JTable` can sort by a single column. But is it possible to allow for multiple column sort or do I need to write the code myself?", "response": " sorter for multi-column sorting in Java?\n\n\nYes, you can achieve this in Java using the `TableRowSorter`. Here's how:\n\nFirstly, create your `JTable`.\n\n```java\nDefaultTableModel model = new DefaultTableModel(data, columnNames);\nJTable table = new JTable(model);\n```\n\nThen, wrap the model with `TableRowSorter`.\n\n```java\nTableRowSorter<TableModel> sorter = new TableRowSorter<>(model);\ntable.setRowSorter(sorter);\n```\n\nTo enable sorting on multiple columns, use `sortOnColumn()` method. You can call it multiple times to add more sorting criteria.\n\n```java\nList<? extends RowSorter.SortKey> sortKeys = Arrays.asList(\n    new RowSorter.SortKey(0, SortOrder.ASCENDING),\n    new RowSorter.SortKey(1, SortOrder.DESCENDING)\n);\nsorter.setSortKeys(sortKeys);\n```\n\nThis will sort first by the first column in ascending order and then by the second column in descending order. \n\nNote: The indices in `RowSorter.SortKey(int column, SortOrder sortOrder)` should match the actual column indexes of your `JTable`."}
