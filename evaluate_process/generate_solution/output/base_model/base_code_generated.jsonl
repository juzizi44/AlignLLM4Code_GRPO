The class should have a method `log` that takes a log level and a message with variable arguments and logs the message according to the specified log level.\n2. The log levels should include `LOGGER_INFO`, `LOGGER_WARNING`, and `LOGGER_ERROR`.\n3. The `log` method should format and output the log message along with any variable arguments provided.\n4. The log messages should be printed to the console.\n\nYour implementation should be able to handle the following log message formats:\n- \"is equivalent.\"\n- \"results in counterexample %s .\", where %s is a string representation of a counterexample.\n\nYou should use the provided code snippet as a reference for the log message formats and the use of the `my_logger` function.\n\nYour task is to implement the `Logger` class and demonstrate its usage by logging messages with different log levels and variable arguments.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nclass Logger:\n    LOGGER_INFO = 0\n    LOGGER_WARNING = 1\n    LOGGER_ERROR = 2\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def log(level, msg, *args):\n        if level == Logger.LOGGER_INFO:\n            print(f\"INFO: {msg % args}\")\n        elif level == Logger.LOGGER_WARNING:\n            print(f\"WARNING: {msg % args}\", file=sys.stderr)\n        elif level == Logger.LOGGER_ERROR:\n            print(f\"ERROR: {msg % args}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n# Example usage of the Logger class\nlogger = Logger()\nlogger.log(Logger.LOGGER_INFO, \"This is an info message.\")\nlogger.log(Logger.LOGGER_WARNING, \"This is a warning message: %s.\", \"counterexample\")\nlogger.log(Logger.LOGGER_ERROR, \"This is an error message: %s.\", \"error occurred\")\n```\n\nIn this solution, we define a `Logger` class with static methods representing different log levels (`LOGGER_INFO`, `LOGGER_WARNING`, `LOGGER_ERROR`). The `log` method takes a log level and a message with variable arguments, formatting and printing the log message accordingly. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `Logger` class to log messages with different log levels and variable arguments."}
