An asset bundler is a tool that combines multiple files (such as JavaScript or CSS) into a single file for optimized delivery to the client's browser. Your program should take a list of input files, apply specified filters to each file, and then output the bundled content to a specified file.\n\nYour program should support the following features:\n- Accept a list of input files for bundling, along with the type of asset (e.g., JavaScript or CSS).\n- Apply specified filters to each input file. Filters are functions that transform the content of the input file in some way (e.g., minification, compression).\n- Output the bundled content to a specified file.\n\nYour program should be able to handle both JavaScript and CSS assets, and apply the appropriate filters for each type.\n\nWrite a function or class that takes input files, filters, and output file as parameters, and produces the bundled content according to the specified filters.\n\nExample:\n```python\ninput_files = {\n  \"js\": [\"libs/jQuery/dist/jquery.js\", \"app/main.js\"],\n  \"css\": [\"styles/reset.css\", \"styles/main.css\"]\n}\nfilters = {\n  \"js\": [\"uglify\"],\n  \"css\": [\"autoprefixer\", \"cssmin\"]\n}\noutput_files = {\n  \"js\": \"public/js/bundle.js\",\n  \"css\": \"public/css/bundle.css\"\n}\n\nbundle_assets(input_files, filters, output_files)\n```", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-1", "answer": "Here's a comprehensive solution that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Callable\n\nclass AssetBundler:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.filters = {\n            'js': {\n                'uglify': self._uglify_js,\n                'minify': self._minify_js\n            },\n            'css': {\n                'autoprefixer': self._autoprefixer_css,\n                'cssmin': self._cssmin_css\n            }\n        }\n\n    def _read_file(self, filepath: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Read file content safely.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            with open(filepath, 'r') as file:\n                return file.read()\n        except IOError as e:\n            print(f\"Error reading file {filepath}: {e}\")\n            return \"\"\n\n    def _write_file(self, filepath: str, content: str) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Write content to file safely.\"\"\"\n        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(filepath), exist_ok=True)\n        try:\n            with open(filepath, 'w') as file:\n                file.write(content)\n        except IOError as e:\n            print(f\"Error writing file {filepath}: {e}\")\n\n    def _uglify_js(self, content: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Simulate JavaScript uglification.\"\"\"\n        return content.replace('\\n', '').replace(' ', '')\n\n    def _minify_js(self, content: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Simulate JavaScript minification.\"\"\"\n        return content.replace('\\t', '').replace('\\n', '')\n\n    def _autoprefixer_css(self, content: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Simulate CSS autoprefixing.\"\"\"\n        return content.replace('transform:', '-webkit-transform: ')\n\n    def _cssmin_css(self, content: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Simulate CSS minification.\"\"\"\n        return content.replace('\\n', '').replace(' ', '')\n\n    def bundle_assets(\n        self, \n        input_files: Dict[str, List[str]], \n        filters: Dict[str, List[str]], \n        output_files: Dict[str, str]\n    ) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Bundle assets with specified filters.\"\"\"\n        for asset_type, files in input_files.items():\n            # Combine file contents\n            combined_content = ''\n            for filepath in files:\n                file_content = self._read_file(filepath)\n                \n                # Apply filters for this asset type\n                for filter_name in filters.get(asset_type, []):\n                    if filter_name in self.filters.get(asset_type, {}):\n                        file_content = self.filters[asset_type][filter_name](file_content)\n                \n                combined_content += file_content\n\n            # Write bundled content to output file\n            output_filepath = output_files.get(asset_type)\n            if output_filepath:\n                self._write_file(output_filepath, combined_content)\n\ndef bundle_assets(\n    input_files: Dict[str, List[str]], \n    filters: Dict[str, List[str]], \n    output_files: Dict[str, str]\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Convenience function to create and run AssetBundler.\"\"\"\n    bundler = AssetBundler()\n    bundler.bundle_assets(input_files, filters, output_files)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_files = {\n        \"js\": [\"libs/jQuery/dist/jquery.js\", \"app/main.js\"],\n        \"css\": [\"styles/reset.css\", \"styles/main.css\"]\n    }\n    filters = {\n        \"js\": [\"uglify\"],\n        \"css\": [\"autoprefixer\", \"cssmin\"]\n    }\n    output_files = {\n        \"js\": \"public/js/bundle.js\",\n        \"css\": \"public/css/bundle.css\"\n    }\n\n    bundle_assets(input_files, filters, output_files)\n```\n\nThis solution adheres to the specified requirements:\n\n1. **Code Structure Simplicity**:\n   -

Keeps the interface simple with clear function names\n2. Uses a configuration structure to avoid multiple initialization parameters\n3. Includes basic data processing functions (averaging and voltage conversion)\n4. Handles different resolutions (8/10/12 bit)\n5. Has proper input validation\n6. Uses appropriate data types (uint16_t for ADC values)\n7. Follows consistent naming conventions\n8.
