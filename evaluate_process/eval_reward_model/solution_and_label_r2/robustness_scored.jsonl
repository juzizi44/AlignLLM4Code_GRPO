If it is, we return `0` since there are no characters to form a subsequence.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will hold the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.\n3. **Initialization**: We initialize the diagonal of the `dp` table with `1` because each character in the string is a palindrome of length `1`.\n4. **Filling the DP Table**: We iterate over all possible substring lengths and fill in the `dp` table:\n    - If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same, we can extend the palindromic subsequence by these two characters and add `2` to the value of `dp[i+1][j-1]`.\n    - If the characters are different, we take the maximum length from either the left or right substring.\n5. **Result**: Finally, the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string is found at `dp[0][n-1]`.\n\n### Robustness Aspects:\n- **Exception Handling**: The function checks for an empty input and handles it gracefully.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: The algorithm properly initializes and handles palindromic subsequences of different lengths.\n- **Resource Management**: Memory is managed through the use of a 2D list, which is cleaned up when it goes out of scope after the function execution.\n\nThis implementation ensures that we can efficiently find the longest palindromic subsequence while maintaining robustness against edge cases.", "final_score": 1.5, "reward_model_score": 1.734375}

The class should also handle potential errors that may occur during the connection process.\n\nYour task is to implement the `PostgresConnection` class with the following specifications:\n- The class should have a constructor that takes in the database username, password, database name, host, and port as parameters and initializes the connection.\n- It should have a method named `connect` that establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the provided credentials.\n- The `execute_query` method should take an SQL query as a parameter and execute it on the connected database. It should return the result of the query execution.\n- The `close_connection` method should close the connection to the database.\n\nYour implementation should handle potential errors such as connection failures and query execution errors by raising custom exceptions with informative error messages.\n\nYour class should be used as follows:\n```python\n# Create an instance of the PostgresConnection class\nconnection = PostgresConnection(\"postgres\", \"admin\", \"postgres\", \"127.0.0.1\", \"5432\")\n\n# Establish the connection\nconnection.connect()\n\n# Execute a sample query\nresult = connection.execute_query(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n\n# Close the connection\nconnection.close_connection()\n```", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-1", "answer": "Here's a comprehensive implementation of the `PostgresConnection` class that adheres to the specified requirements:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nfrom psycopg2 import Error\nfrom typing import List, Any\n\nclass DatabaseConnectionError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Custom exception for database connection errors.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass QueryExecutionError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Custom exception for query execution errors.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass PostgresConnection:\n    def __init__(self, username: str, password: str, database: str, host: str, port: str):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the PostgreSQL database connection parameters.\n        \n        Args:\n            username (str): Database username\n            password (str): Database password\n            database (str): Database name\n            host (str): Database host\n            port (str): Database port\n        \"\"\"\n        self._username = username\n        self._password = password\n        self._database = database\n        self._host = host\n        self._port = port\n        self._connection = None\n        self._cursor = None\n\n    def connect(self) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database.\n        \n        Raises:\n            DatabaseConnectionError: If connection fails\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            #

Your task is to implement a function that calculates the Euclidean distance between each pair of points and returns the pair of points with the maximum distance between them.\n\nYou should implement the following function:\n\n```python\ndef max_distance_points(points: List[Tuple[float, float]]) -> Tuple[Tuple[float, float], Tuple[float, float]]:\n    pass\n```\n\n**Input:**\n- The input `points` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a 2D point in the form (x, y). The length of the list is at least 2 and at most 1000. The x and y coordinates are floating-point numbers.\n\n**Output:**\n- The function should return a tuple of two tuples, where the first tuple represents the pair of points with the maximum distance between them.\n\n**Note:**\n- The Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\npoints = [(-0.0697622150950153008986, 0.046432560482317929183),\n          (-0.0232708715407507060344, 0.0465333413404968638234),\n          (0.02327087154075070603437, 0.0465333413404968638234),\n          (0.0697622150950153008986, 0.0464325604823179291833),\n          (0.1161024692216898182267, 0.046231217034791425205),\n          (0.1621912712463770264451, 0.0459297470628552269276),\n          (0.2079288030837679729796, 0.045528803483127572753),\n          (0.2532160074213070237007, 0.0450292546498245100301),\n          (0.2979548022551796483432, 0.0444321824740826399099),\n          (0.3420482933139803129623, 0.043738880080758951608),\n          (0.3854009839099910183841, 0.0429508490077806243141),\n          (0.4279189817635698486723, 0.042069795954107501617),\n          (0.4695102023527009595653, 0.0410976290833462117396)]\n\nmax_distance_points(points)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n((0.4695102023527009595653, 0.0410976290833462117396), (-0.0697622150950153008986, 0.046432560482317929183))\n```", "generation_model": "gpt-4o-mini-1", "answer": "Here is the implementation of the `max_distance_points` function that calculates the Euclidean distance between each pair of points and returns the pair of points with the maximum distance between them.

A primitive string is a balanced parentheses string that cannot be split into smaller balanced parentheses strings. The approach involves identifying these primitive strings and then stripping their outermost parentheses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Primitive Strings**: We can use a counter to keep track of the balance of parentheses. Whenever the counter increments to 1, it signifies the start of a primitive string. When the counter decrements to 0, it signifies the end of a primitive string.\n2. **Process Each Primitive String**: For each identified primitive string, we exclude the first and last parentheses (the outermost ones) and include the rest in the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef removeOuterParentheses(s: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    balance = 0\n    start = 0\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char == '(':\n            balance += 1\n        else:\n            balance -= 1\n        if balance == 0:\n            result.append(s[start+1:i])\n            start = i + 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` to collect the processed strings, a `balance` counter to track the parentheses balance, and a `start` index to mark the beginning of each primitive string.\n2. **Iterate Through the String**: For each character in the string:\n   - If the character is '(', increment the balance.\n   - If the character is ')', decrement the balance.\n3. **Check for Primitive String**: Whenever the balance returns to 0, it means we have found a complete primitive string from `start` to the current index `i`. The primitive string's content without the outermost parentheses is from `start+1` to `i-1`, which we append to `result`.\n4. **Update Start Index**: After processing each primitive string, update the `start` index to `i+1` to begin processing the next primitive string.\n5. **Return Result**: Join all the processed strings in `result` and return the concatenated string.\n\nThis approach efficiently breaks down the input string into primitive strings, processes each by removing the outermost parentheses, and combines the results into the desired output.

A general exception handler is also included for unexpected errors.\n6. **Entry Point**: The script checks if it's run as the main program, imports the `folder_walk` module, and specifies a directory to analyze (currently set to the current directory).\n\nThis script is designed to be robust and handle various edge cases, ensuring smooth operation under different scenarios.", "final_score": 2.5, "reward_model_score": 1.1328125}
