A palindromic subsequence is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards, but the characters do not need to be contiguous. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solving this problem involves dynamic programming (DP). The key idea is to use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i..j]`. \n\n1. **Initialization**: For any single character, the longest palindromic subsequence is 1. Hence, `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i`.\n2. **Filling the DP Table**: For a substring `s[i..j]`:\n   - If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same, then `dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]`.\n   - If the characters are different, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.\n3. **Order of Computation**: The table is filled in a bottom-up manner, starting from substrings of length 1 and gradually increasing the length until the entire string is considered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef longestPalindromeSubseq(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if s[i] == s[j]:\n                dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n    \n    return dp[0][n-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized as an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.\n2. **Base Case**: Each single character is a palindrome of length 1, so `dp[i][i]` is set to 1 for all `i`.\n3. **Filling the Table**: The outer loop starts from the end of the string and moves backwards (`i` from `n-1` to `0`). The inner loop starts from `i+1` to the end of the string (`j` from `i+1` to `n-1`). \n   - **Matching Characters**: If `s[i]` matches `s[j]`, the value of `dp[i][j]` is set to 2 plus the value of the subsequence from `i+1` to `j-1` (i.e., `dp[i+1][j-1]`).\n   - **Non-Matching Characters**: If the characters do not match, the value is the maximum of the subsequence from `i+1` to `j` or from `i` to `j-1`.\n4. **Result Extraction**: The result is found in `dp[0][n-1]`, which contains the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string `s[0..n-1]`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using dynamic programming by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and building up the solution in a bottom-up manner.

If the inner substring is of length 0 (i.e., `i+1 > j-1`), then it simply adds 2 (since two matching characters contribute 2 to the length).\n   - **Characters Do Not Match**: If the characters do not match, the value is the maximum of either excluding the leftmost character (`dp[i+1][j]`) or excluding the rightmost character (`dp[i][j-1]`).\n4. **Result**: The result for the entire string is found in `dp[0][n-1]`, which gives the length of the longest palindromic subsequence from the first to the last character of the string.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using dynamic programming by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and building up the solution in a bottom-up manner.

The function should extract and convert these readings to voltage values based on the provided resolution and return them in a list.\n\nExample:\n```python\npacket = b'\\x12\\x34\\x56\\x78'\n# Assume the packet contains 4 sensor readings\n# The 10-bit readings are: 0b0001001001, 0b00110100, 0b01010110, 0b01111000\n# Convert to voltage values: 0.117, 0.268, 0.422, 0.574 volts\nparse_data_packet(packet)  # Output: [0.117, 0.268, 0.422, 0.574]\n```", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-2", "answer": "Here's a modular and well-structured implementation of the `parse_data_packet` function that follows the MTS Log protocol parsing requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef extract_10bit_readings(packet: bytes) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract 10-bit readings from the input byte packet.\n    \n    Args:\n        packet (bytes): Input byte array containing packed 10-bit readings\n    \n    Returns:\n        List[int]: List of 10-bit integer readings\n    \"\"\"\n    readings = []\n    for i in range(0, len(packet), 5):\n        if i + 5 <= len(packet):\n            # Extract 10-bit readings from consecutive bytes\n            first_byte = packet[i]\n            second_byte = packet[i + 1]\n            third_byte = packet[i + 2]\n            fourth_byte = packet[i + 3]\n            fifth_byte = packet[i + 4]\n            \n            # First 10-bit reading\n            reading1 = ((first_byte << 2) | (second_byte >> 6)) & 0x3FF\n            \n            # Second 10-bit reading\n            reading2 = (((second_byte & 0x3F) << 4) | (third_byte >> 4)) & 0x3FF\n            \n            # Third 10-bit reading\n            reading3 = (((third_byte & 0x0F) << 6) | (fourth_byte >> 2)) & 0x3FF\n            \n            # Fourth 10-bit reading\n            reading4 = (((fourth_byte & 0x03) << 8) | fifth_byte) & 0x3FF\n            \n            readings.extend([reading1, reading2, reading3, reading4])\n    \n    return readings\n\ndef convert_to_voltage(reading: int, max_voltage: float = 5.0, resolution: int = 10) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a 10-bit reading to voltage.\n    \n    Args:\n        reading (int): 10-bit integer reading\n        max_voltage (float): Maximum voltage range (default: 5.0V)\n        resolution (int): Bit resolution (default: 10 bits)\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: Voltage value with 0.1% precision\n    \"\"\"\n    voltage = (reading / (2**resolution - 1)) * max_voltage\n    return round(voltage, 3)\n\ndef parse_data_packet(packet: bytes) -> List[float]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Parse MTS Log protocol data packet and extract sensor readings.\n    \n    Args:\n        packet (bytes): Input byte array representing a data packet\n    \n    Returns:\n        List[float]: List of sensor readings in volts\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate packet length (must be divisible by 5)\n    if len(packet) % 5 != 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid packet length.

A primitive string is a balanced parentheses string that cannot be split into smaller balanced parentheses strings. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Primitive Strings**: We can identify primitive strings by tracking the balance of parentheses. A primitive string starts when the balance is zero (after processing some characters) and ends when the balance returns to zero again.\n2. **Process Each Primitive String**: For each identified primitive string, we remove the first and last parentheses (the outermost ones) and keep the inner part.\n3. **Concatenate Results**: After processing all primitive strings, concatenate the results to form the final output string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef removeOuterParentheses(s: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    balance = 0\n    start = 0\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char == '(':\n            balance += 1\n        else:\n            balance -= 1\n        \n        if balance == 0:\n            result.append(s[start+1:i])\n            start = i + 1\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tracking Balance**: The variable `balance` keeps track of the number of open parentheses. Each time an opening parenthesis `(` is encountered, `balance` is incremented by 1, and each time a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, `balance` is decremented by 1.\n2. **Identifying Primitive Strings**: When `balance` returns to zero, it indicates the end of a primitive string.

A primitive string is defined as a balanced parentheses string that cannot be split into smaller balanced parentheses strings. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Primitive Strings**: We can identify primitive strings by tracking the balance of parentheses. A primitive string starts when the balance is 0 (indicating the start of a new primitive string) and ends when the balance returns to 0 (indicating the end of the current primitive string).\n2. **Process Each Primitive String**: For each identified primitive string, we need to exclude the outermost parentheses. This means we take the substring from the second character to the second last character of each primitive string.\n3. **Concatenate Results**: After processing each primitive string, we concatenate the results to form the final output string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef removeOuterParentheses(s: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    balance = 0\n    start = 0\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char == '(':\n            balance += 1\n        else:\n            balance -= 1\n        \n        if balance == 0:\n            result.append(s[start+1:i])\n            start = i + 1\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` to store the processed parts of the string, a variable `balance` to keep track of the parentheses balance, and `start` to mark the beginning of a primitive string.\n2. **Iterate Through the String**: For each character in the string:\n   - If the character is '(', we increment the balance.\n   - If the character is ')', we decrement the balance.\n3. **Check for Primitive String**: Whenever the balance returns to 0, it means we have found a complete primitive string. The primitive string spans from `start` to the current index `i`. We then append the substring excluding the outermost parentheses (from `start+1` to `i-1`) to the result list.\n4. **Update Start Position**: After processing a primitive string, we update `start` to the next character (`i + 1`) to begin processing the next primitive string.\n5. **Return Result**: Finally, we join all the processed substrings in the result list and return the concatenated string.\n\nThis approach efficiently breaks down the input string into primitive strings, processes each to remove the outermost parentheses, and combines the results to produce the desired output.

Note that the user must have a password set for this to work.\n3. **Organization Creation**: Here, we simulate creating an organization. In a production setting, you would replace this with actual model interactions.\n4. **Path Generation**: We generate the URL path using Django's `reverse` function, which constructs URLs from named routes.\n5. **POST Request**: We prepare the payload for creating a team and make a POST request to the generated path, which will include the team data.\n6. **Response Return**: Finally, the function returns the response from the POST request.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that the test case includes the necessary setup, such as creating the user and setting the required password.\n- This implementation assumes the existence of a URL pattern named `create_team` in your Django application's URL configuration.
