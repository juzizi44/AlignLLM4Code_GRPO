Includes proper type checking in `__eq__` to ensure we only compare with other `Table` objects\n4. Follows Python's convention that equal objects must have equal hash values\n5. Maintains all the required properties for hashable objects in Python\n\nThe implementation ensures that:\n- Two `Table` objects with the same schema and table_name will be considered equal\n- The hash value will be consistent with equality (equal objects have equal hashes)\n- The objects can be used in sets and as dictionary keys", "final_score": 30.0}

First, single characters are palindromes of length 1\n  2. Then we build up to find the longest palindromic subsequence\n  3. The result is 4 (the subsequence \"bbbb\")\n\n**Naming and Style Conventions**:\n- Function name follows camelCase convention\n- Variable names are descriptive (e.g., `n` for length, `dp` for dynamic programming table)\n- Clear comments explain the logic and purpose of each section\n- Consistent indentation and formatting\n\nThe solution handles various input scenarios and efficiently finds the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.", "final_score": 30.0}

It should return the result of the query execution.\n- The `close_connection` method should close the connection to the database.\n\nYour implementation should handle potential errors such as connection failures and query execution errors by raising custom exceptions with informative error messages.\n\nYour class should be used as follows:\n```python\n# Create an instance of the PostgresConnection class\nconnection = PostgresConnection(\"postgres\", \"admin\", \"postgres\", \"127.0.0.1\", \"5432\")\n\n# Establish the connection\nconnection.connect()\n\n# Execute a sample query\nresult = connection.execute_query(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n\n# Close the connection\nconnection.close_connection()\n```", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-2", "answer": "Here's a comprehensive implementation of the `PostgresConnection` class that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nfrom psycopg2 import Error\n\nclass PostgresConnectionError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Custom exception for PostgreSQL connection errors.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass PostgresConnection:\n    \"\"\"\n    A class to manage PostgreSQL database connections.\n\n    This class provides methods to establish, execute queries, and close \n    a connection to a PostgreSQL database with robust error handling.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, username, password, database, host, port):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the PostgreSQL connection parameters.\n\n        Args:\n            username (str): Database username\n            password (str): Database password\n            database (str): Database name\n            host (str): Database host\n            port (str): Database port\n        \"\"\"\n        self.username = username\n        self.password = password\n        self.database = database\n        self.host = host\n        self.port = port\n        self.connection = None\n        self.cursor = None\n\n    def connect(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database.\n\n        Raises:\n            PostgresConnectionError: If connection fails\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            self.connection = psycopg2.connect(\n                user=self.username,\n                password=self.password,\n                database=self.database,\n                host=self.host,\n                port=self.port\n            )\n            self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()\n            print(\"Successfully connected to PostgreSQL database\")\n        except (Error, psycopg2.Error) as error:\n            raise PostgresConnectionError(f\"Error connecting to database: {error}\")\n\n    def execute_query(self, query):\n        \"\"\"\n        Execute a SQL query on the connected database.\n\n        Args:\n            query (str): SQL query to execute\n\n        Returns:\n            list: Query results\n\n        Raises:\n            PostgresConnectionError: If query execution fails\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self.connection or not self.cursor:\n            raise PostgresConnectionError(\"No active database connection\")\n\n        try:\n            self.cursor.execute(query)\n            \n            #

It enters an infinite loop that waits for incoming connections. When a client successfully connects, it sends a welcome message.\n\n2. **Client Functionality**: The `startClient` function attempts to connect to the server at `127.0.0.1` on port 55001. If the connection is successful, it waits to receive a message from the server and then outputs that message to the console.\n\n3. **Threading**: The server runs in a separate thread to allow the client to connect immediately after the server starts. This ensures that both server and client can run simultaneously in the same program.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Simple error messages are printed to the console to inform the user if there are any issues starting the server, connecting the client, or receiving messages.\n\nMake sure to have the SFML library properly set up in your development environment to compile and run this code.", "final_score": 28.666666666666668}

This implementation checks if the user is logged in and has the necessary permissions to access the keyword data, and then generates the appropriate CSV response.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request, make_response\nimport csv\nimport io\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Mock user session and permission for demonstration purposes\ncurrent_user = {\n    'is_logged_in': True,\n    'permissions': ['view_keyword_data']\n}\n\ndef login_required(f):\n    \"\"\"Decorator to ensure the user is logged in.\"\"\"\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        if not current_user.get('is_logged_in', False):\n            return jsonify({'error': 'User must be logged in to access this resource.'}), 403\n        return f(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\ndef keyword_access_check(f):\n    \"\"\"Decorator to ensure the user has access to the keyword data.\"\"\"\n    def wrapper(keyword, *args, **kwargs):\n        if 'view_keyword_data' not in current_user.get('permissions', []):\n            return jsonify({'error': 'User does not have permission to access this keyword data.'}), 403\n        return f(keyword, *args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\n@app.route('/keyword_csv/<keyword>', methods=['GET'])\n@login_required\n@keyword_access_check\ndef keyword_csv(keyword):\n    \"\"\"Returns a CSV file containing responses for a single keyword.\"\"\"\n    # Sample data for CSV response\n    data = [\n        {'Keyword': keyword, 'Response': 'Sample response 1'},\n        {'Keyword': keyword, 'Response': 'Sample response 2'},\n    ]\n\n    # Create a CSV response\n    output = io.StringIO()\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(output, fieldnames=['Keyword', 'Response'])\n    writer.writeheader()\n    writer.writerows(data)\n    \n    output.seek(0)\n    \n    response = make_response(output.getvalue())\n    response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename=\"{keyword}_responses.csv\"'\n    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/csv'\n    \n    return response\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Decorators**:\n   - The `login_required` decorator checks if the user is logged in. If not, it returns a 403 Forbidden error with a JSON message.\n   - The `keyword_access_check` decorator checks if the user has the required permissions to access keyword data. If the permission is absent, it returns a 403 Forbidden error.\n\n2. **CSV Response Creation**:\n   - The `keyword_csv` function generates a CSV file based on the provided keyword. It creates sample data, writes it to a CSV format using `csv.DictWriter`, and prepares the response with appropriate headers for file download.\n\n3. **Flask Setup**:\n   - The Flask app is set up to run on the default port, and the endpoint `/keyword_csv/<keyword>` accepts `GET` requests to retrieve the CSV file.\n\n### Note:\nMake sure you have Flask installed in your environment (`pip install Flask`) to run this code snippet.

The function `calculateConsonantCount` takes a single parameter `inputString`, which is the string to be analyzed.\n2. We initialize a variable `consonants` to keep track of the total number of consonants.\n3. We loop through each character in the `inputString`.\n4. For each character, we check if it is an alphabetic character using the `isalpha()` method. This ensures we only consider letters, and not other characters like numbers or punctuation.\n5. We then check if the lowercase version of the character is not a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) using the `lower()` method and the `in` operator.\n6. If the character is an alphabetic character and not a vowel, we increment the `consonants` counter.\n7. Finally, we return the total count of consonants.\n\nYou can call this function with a string as an argument, and it will return the total number of consonants in the input string.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"Hello, World!\"\nconsonant_count = calculateConsonantCount(input_string)\nprint(consonant_count)  # Output: 3\n```\n\nIn the example above, the function correctly identifies the 3 consonants in the input string: \"H\", \"l\", and \"l\".", "final_score": 21.0}

This ensures spaces are retained in the output (assuming they are not considered \"special\" in this context).\n\n2. **Correct Use of `remove_copy_if`**: \n   - Uses `std::back_inserter(result)` to dynamically grow the `result` string as characters are copied. This avoids the issue of fixed-size buffers and trailing garbage.\n   - The `result` string is initially empty and filled only with valid characters.\n\n3. **Output**: The corrected code will output:\n   ```\n   Hello This is a string\n   ```\n   (Special characters `!&@#%^$` are removed, while spaces and alphabetic characters are retained.)\n\n### Alternative Version (If Spaces Should Also Be Removed) ###\nIf spaces should also be treated as \"special\" and removed, modify the `is_special` function as follows:\n```cpp\nbool is_special(char c) {\n    return !isalpha(c); // Remove everything except alphabetic characters\n}\n```\nThe rest of the code remains the same.

By using an in-place algorithm with a partitioning strategy, the optimized code reduces the overhead associated with list creation and enhances performance, particularly beneficial for larger datasets.

The key challenge is to manage the state transitions between buying and selling while keeping track of the number of transactions used.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We will use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit achievable with `i` transactions and `j` state (0 for holding a stock, 1 for not holding a stock).\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize a DP table where `dp[t][0]` (holding a stock) starts with `-prices[0]` for all possible transactions up to `k`, and `dp[t][1]` (not holding) starts at 0.\n3. **State Transitions**:\n   - **Buying a Stock (Transition to Holding State)**: For each day and each possible transaction count, the maximum value of holding a stock is either continuing to hold from the previous day or buying a new stock (using the profit from the previous transaction minus the current price).\n   - **Selling a Stock (Transition to Not Holding State)**: The maximum value of not holding a stock is either continuing not to hold or selling the stock held (using the profit from holding plus the current price minus the fee).\n4. **Result Extraction**: The result is found in `dp[k][1]`, which represents the maximum profit after at most `k` transactions and not holding any stock.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef maxProfit(k, prices, fee):\n    if not prices or k == 0:\n        return 0\n    n = len(prices)\n    if k >= n // 2:\n        # If k is large enough, the problem becomes similar to unlimited transactions\n        max_profit = 0\n        buy = prices[0]\n        for price in prices[1:]:\n            if price > buy + fee:\n                max_profit += price - buy - fee\n                buy = price  # Avoid overlapping fees by setting buy to price\n            elif price < buy:\n                buy = price\n        return max_profit\n    else:\n        # DP table where dp[t][0] represents max profit with t transactions and holding a stock\n        # dp[t][1] represents max profit with t transactions and not holding a stock\n        dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(k + 1)]\n        for t in range(k + 1):\n            dp[t][0] = -prices[0]  # Initialize holding state\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            for t in range(k, 0, -1):\n                dp[t][1] = max(dp[t][1], dp[t][0] + prices[i] - fee)\n                dp[t][0] = max(dp[t][0], dp[t - 1][1] - prices[i])\n        return dp[k][1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: If there are no prices or zero transactions allowed, the profit is zero.\n2. **Large `k` Handling**: If `k` is large enough (more than half the number of days), the problem reduces to making as many transactions as possible without worrying about the transaction limit. Here, we buy low and sell high, accounting for the fee each time we sell.\n3. **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table is initialized to track the maximum profit for up to `k` transactions. The initial holding state is set to `-prices[0]` for all transaction counts, representing buying the stock on the first day.\n4. **State Transitions**: For each subsequent day, we update the DP table in reverse order of transactions to avoid overwriting values needed for the current day's calculations. The transitions involve either continuing the current state or switching states (buying or selling) while updating the profit accordingly.\n5. **Result Extraction**: The result is found in `dp[k][1]`, which holds the maximum profit after at most `k` transactions and ending without holding any stock.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures optimal profit calculation while accounting for transaction fees and limits.", "final_score": 26.333333333333332}

If either condition is true, it returns 0 as no transactions can be made.\n3. **Transaction Limit Check**: If `k` is large enough to allow for unlimited transactions (greater than half the number of days), it calculates the profit in a simple way by summing up all profitable transactions.\n4. **Dynamic Programming Table**: It initializes a 2D list `dp` to keep track of profits. The first index corresponds to the number of transactions completed, and the second index represents whether we are currently holding a stock (1) or not (0).\n5. **State Transition**: The loops iterate over each day's price, updating the `dp` table based on the maximum profit achievable by buying and selling stocks.\n6. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the maximum profit from at most `k` transactions stored in `dp[k][1]`.\n\nThis code is structured for clarity and adheres to best practices, ensuring effective readability and maintainability.", "final_score": 27.333333333333332}

Defaults to 't'.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if any item starts with the specified character, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item and item[0].lower() == char.lower():\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef find_indices_starting_with(str_param, str_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find indices of strings in the list that start with the given parameter.\n    \n    Args:\n        str_param (str): Character or string to match at the start of list items\n        str_list (list): List of strings to search\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: Indices of strings starting with the given parameter\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use list comprehension to find indices\n    return [index for index, item in enumerate(str_list) \n            if item and item.lower().startswith(str_param.lower())]\n\n# Test cases\ndef test_functions():\n    # Test starts_with_char function\n    assert starts_with_char(['dog', 'turtle', 'cat']) == True\n    assert starts_with_char(['dog', 'cat', 'ball']) == False\n    assert starts_with_char(['Dog', 'Turtle', 'Cat'], 'T') == True\n    \n    # Test find_indices_starting_with function\n    test_list = ['dog', 'turtle', 'cat', 'treasure', 'pirates', 'team', 'ball']\n    \n    # Test with 't'\n    assert find_indices_starting_with('t', test_list) == [1, 3, 5]\n    \n    # Test case insensitivity\n    assert find_indices_starting_with('T', test_list) == [1, 3, 5]\n    \n    # Test with empty list\n    assert find_indices_starting_with('t', []) == []\n    \n    # Test with no matches\n    assert find_indices_starting_with('x', test_list) == []\n    \n    print(\"All tests passed!\")\n\n# Run the tests\ntest_functions()\n```\n\nKey Improvements and Corrections:\n\n1. Corrected Helper Function:\n   - The original `starts_with_t` function had a critical error by checking the second character (`item[1]`) instead of the first character.\n   - The new `starts_with_char` function:\n     - Checks the first character (`item[0]`)\n     - Handles empty lists\n     - Supports case-insensitive matching\n     - Allows specifying the character to match (defaulting to 't')\n\n2. Main Function Enhancements:\n   - `find_indices_starting_with` uses a list comprehension for concise and efficient index finding\n   - Supports case-insensitive matching\n   - Handles empty lists and lists with no matches\n\n3. Comprehensive Test Cases:\n   - Covers various scenarios:\n     - Matching with 't'\n     - Case insensitivity\n     - Empty list\n     - No matches\n     - Different input variations\n\n4. Docstrings:\n   - Added clear, descriptive docstrings explaining function purpose, arguments, and return values\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Added checks for empty strings and lists to prevent index errors\n\nThe solution demonstrates:\n- Robust error handling\n- Case-insensitive matching\n- Flexible character checking\n- Efficient list comprehension\n- Comprehensive testing\n\nWhen you run this code, it will execute the test cases and print \"All tests passed!\" if everything works correctly.", "final_score": 30.0}
