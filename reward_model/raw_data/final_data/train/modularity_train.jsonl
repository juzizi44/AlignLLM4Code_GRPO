i < 25; ++i) {\n    data[i] = static_cast<float>(i);\n}\n\n// Flush the modified range\nbuffer_manager.flush_range(0, 100);\n\n// Unmap the buffer\nbuffer_manager.unmap_buffer();\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a robust, modular approach to OpenGL buffer management, ensuring efficient and precise control over buffer ranges while maintaining clean separation of concerns.", "final_score": 27.0}

i < 100; ++i) {\n    data[i] = some_calculation(i);\n}\n\n// Flush the modified range\nbufferManager.flush_range(0, 100);\n\n// Unmap the buffer\nbufferManager.unmap_buffer();\n```\n\nThe implementation ensures efficient and precise buffer range management while maintaining clear separation of concerns and providing robust error handling.", "final_score": 29.666666666666668}

We inherit from `permissions.BasePermission`, which is the base class for custom permissions in Django REST Framework.\n\n2. In the `has_permission` method, we first check two conditions:\n   - `request.user` exists (is not None)\n   - The user is authenticated using `is_authenticated`\n\n3. If either of these conditions is not met (i.e., user is not authenticated), we return `False`, denying access.\n\n4. We use `request.user.groups.exists()` to check if the user belongs to any group:\n   - This method returns `True` if the user is a member of at least one group\n   - If the user belongs to no groups, it returns `False`\n\nThis implementation ensures that:\n- Only authenticated users can access the view\n- Users must be a member of at least one group to gain access\n- The permission check is simple and straightforward\n\nYou can use this permission class in your Django REST Framework views by adding it to the `permission_classes` attribute, like this:\n\n```python\nfrom rest_framework.views import APIView\nfrom rest_framework.response import Response\n\nclass ExampleView(APIView):\n    permission_classes = [AnyGroupJWTBasePermission]\n    \n    def get(self, request):\n        return Response({\"message\": \"Access granted to user in a group\"})\n```\n\nThe code meets all the requirements:\n- It checks for user authentication\n- It verifies group membership\n- It provides a clear, single-responsibility implementation\n- It follows the principle of low coupling by being a standalone permission class", "final_score": 24.333333333333332}

principles:\n\n1. **Single Responsibility Principle**:\n   - The class has a clear, focused responsibility of connecting to an MQTT broker and subscribing to a topic.\n   - Methods are small and have a single, well-defined purpose.\n   - The `handleMessage` method is designed to be overridable, allowing custom message processing.\n\n2. **Module Independence**:\n   - The class is self-contained and doesn't depend on external state.\n   - It uses dependency injection for broker URL, client ID, topic, and QoS.\n   - Logging is used for tracking events without creating tight dependencies.\n\n3. **Code Reusability**:\n   - The `handleMessage` method can be easily extended by subclasses.\n   - Input validation is centralized in a separate method.\n   - Logging provides a consistent way to track events across different uses.\n\n4. **Interface Design**:\n   - Clear method signatures with descriptive parameter names.\n   - Comprehensive error handling and parameter validation.\n   - Logging provides insight into the module's operation.\n\n5. **Low Coupling**:\n   - Minimal dependencies between methods.\n   - Connection and subscription logic is separated.\n   - Uses standard Java logging instead of tightly coupled logging frameworks.\n\nKey Features:\n- Robust error handling\n- Comprehensive logging\n- Flexible message handling\n- Input parameter validation\n- Clean, modular design\n\nTo use this class, you would extend it and override the `handleMessage` method to implement your specific message processing logic:\n\n```java\npublic class MyMqttSubscriber extends MqttSubscriber {\n    @Override\n    protected void handleMessage(String topic, MqttMessage message) {\n        // Custom message processing logic\n        System.out.println(\"Processing message: \" + new String(message.getPayload()));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of the implementation or discuss how it meets the modularity requirements?", "final_score": 29.0}

The list should be sorted in ascending order based on the Euclidean distances.\n\nFor example, given the following dataset:\n```\ndataset = [\n    [1, 16.8973559126, 2.6933495054, 1.0],\n    [1, 5.5548729596, 2.7777687995, 1.0],\n    [0, 46.1810010826, 3.1611961917, 0.0],\n    [0, 44.3117586448, 3.3458963222, 0.0],\n    [0, 34.6334526911, 3.6429838715, 0.0]\n]\n```\nand a query point:\n```\nquery_point = [10.0, 3.0, 1.5]\n```\nthe function call `calculate_distances(dataset, query_point)` should return:\n```\n[(1, 5.684354368), (0, 36.1980010826), (2, 36.1980010826), (4, 36.1980010826), (3, 38.1282435204)]\n```\nwhere each tuple contains the index of the record in the dataset and its corresponding Euclidean distance from the query point.", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-2", "answer": "Here's the Python function that calculates the Euclidean distances between each record in the dataset and the given query point:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distances(dataset, query_point):\n    distances = []\n    for i, record in enumerate(dataset):\n        class_label, feature1, feature2, feature3 = record\n        query_feature1, query_feature2, query_feature3 = query_point\n        distance = math.sqrt((feature1 - query_feature1)**2 + (feature2 - query_feature2)**2 + (feature3 - query_feature3)**2)\n        distances.append((i, distance))\n    \n    distances.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    return distances\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes two parameters: `dataset` (a list of lists, where each inner list represents a record) and `query_point` (a list of three numerical values representing the query point).\n2. The function initializes an empty list called `distances` to store the index and Euclidean distance for each record.\n3. The function iterates through each record in the `dataset`, extracts the class label and three feature values, and calculates the Euclidean distance between the record and the `query_point` using the formula `math.sqrt((feature1 - query_feature1)**2 + (feature2 - query_feature2)**2 + (feature3 - query_feature3)**2)`.\n4. The function appends a tuple containing the index of the record and its Euclidean distance to the `distances` list.\n5. After iterating through all the records, the function sorts the `distances` list in ascending order based on the Euclidean distances.\n6.

The method uses a `HashSet` to track seen elements, which is a good approach because `HashSet` provides average O(1) time complexity for both `contains` and `add` operations.

If the element is already present, `add` returns `false`, indicating a duplicate.\n4. **Return Value**: If a duplicate is found, the method immediately returns `true`. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the method returns `false`.\n\n### Efficiency:\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

Its constructor takes two parameters: `obj` (a dictionary representing the key-value pair object) and `options` (an optional `Options` object).\n4.

The `create_object` method returns a dictionary containing the object's attributes, including the `id`, `items`, `max_len`, and `render_options`.\n\nWith this implementation, you can create instances of the `KvpHeapObjectFactory` class and use the `create_object` method to generate the desired heap objects.", "final_score": 27.666666666666668}

It uses an `unordered_map` to store the `ConfigVariable` objects, with the name as the key.\n3. The `registerConfigVariable` method is used to add a new configuration variable to the `ConfigManager`.\n4. The `getDescription` method takes the name of a configuration variable as a parameter and returns its description. If the variable is not found, it returns the string \"Variable not found\".\n5.

For \"migrate\" operations, the function should generate an SQL statement to apply the migration, while for \"rollback\" operations, it should generate an SQL statement to revert the migration.\n\nThe function signature should be:\n```python\ndef generate_sql_statements(operations: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> List[str]:\n    pass\n```\n\nFor example, given the following list of operations:\n```python\noperations = [\n    ('migrate', '0001_initial'),\n    ('rollback', '0002_auto_20170417_0012'),\n    ('migrate', '0003_auto_20170417_0012'),\n    ('migrate', '0004_auto_20170417_0012'),\n    ('rollback', '0005_auto_20170417_0012'),\n]\n```\nThe function should generate the corresponding SQL statements:\n```\n[\n    \"APPLY MIGRATION '0001_initial'\",\n    \"REVERT MIGRATION '0002_auto_20170417_0012'\",\n    \"APPLY MIGRATION '0003_auto_20170417_0012'\",\n    \"APPLY MIGRATION '0004_auto_20170417_0012'\",\n    \"REVERT MIGRATION '0005_auto_20170417_0012'\"\n]\n```\nNote: The SQL statements should follow the format \"APPLY MIGRATION '<version_number>'\" for \"migrate\" operations and \"REVERT MIGRATION '<version_number>'\" for \"rollback\" operations.", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-2", "answer": " I'll solve this problem by creating a modular Python function that generates SQL statements for database migrations, focusing on clear code structure and separation of concerns.\n\n\n```python \nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef generate_sql_statements(operations: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate SQL statements for database migration operations.\n    \n    Args:\n        operations (List[Tuple[str, str]]): A list of migration operations.\n                                            Each operation is a tuple of (operation_type, version_number).\n    \n    Returns:\n        List[str]: A list of SQL statements corresponding to the migration operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    def generate_migrate_statement(version: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Generate an SQL statement for migrating to a specific version.\n        \n        Args:\n            version (str): The migration version number.\n        \n        Returns:\n            str: SQL statement to apply the migration.\n        \"\"\"\n        return f\"APPLY MIGRATION '{version}'\"\n    \n    def generate_rollback_statement(version: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Generate an SQL statement for rolling back a specific version.\n        \n        Args:\n            version (str): The migration version number.\n        \n        Returns:\n            str: SQL statement to revert the migration.\n        \"\"\"\n        return f\"REVERT MIGRATION '{version}'\"\n    \n    # Map operation types to corresponding statement generation functions\n    operation_handlers = {\n        'migrate': generate_migrate_statement,\n        'rollback': generate_rollback_statement\n    }\n    \n    # Generate SQL statements based on the operations\n    sql_statements = [\n        operation_handlers[operation_type](version)\n        for operation_type, version in operations\n    ]\n    \n    return sql_statements\n\n```\n\n\nLet me explain the design choices that enhance code modularity and maintainability:\n\n1. **Single Responsibility Principle**:\n   - The main `generate_sql_statements` function focuses on orchestrating the SQL statement generation.\n   - Two separate helper functions `generate_migrate_statement` and `generate_rollback_statement` handle specific statement generation logic.\n\n2. **Module Independence**:\n   - Each function has a clear, independent responsibility.\n   - The helper functions are self-contained and can be easily extended or modified without affecting other parts of the code.\n\n3. **Code Reusability**:\n   - The `operation_handlers` dictionary allows easy addition of new operation types without modifying existing code.\n   - Helper functions are generic and can be used in different contexts.\n\n4. **Interface Clarity**:\n   - Type hints are used to clearly define input and output types.\n   - Docstrings provide clear documentation for each function.\n\n5. **Low Coupling**:\n   - The code uses a functional approach with minimal interdependencies.\n   - Each function operates independently with clear inputs and outputs.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\noperations = [\n    ('migrate', '0001_initial'),\n    ('rollback', '0002_auto_20170417_0012'),\n    ('migrate', '0003_auto_20170417_0012'),\n    ('migrate', '0004_auto_20170417_0012'),\n    ('rollback', '0005_auto_20170417_0012'),\n]\n\nsql_statements = generate_sql_statements(operations)\nprint(sql_statements)\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a clean, modular solution that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.", "final_score": 30.0}

Raises `CircularDependencyError` if a circular dependency is detected\n   - Raises `MissingDependencyError` if a required dependency is not found\n\n3. **Flexible Design**:\n   - Simulates migration operations with a simple `AddField` class\n   - Can handle migrations from different apps with varying dependencies\n\n4. **Detailed Tracking**:\n   - Prints out each operation as it's \"applied\"\n   - Returns a list of applied migrations in the correct order\n\nThe function works by:\n- Creating a dependency graph\n- Using depth-first search to detect and resolve dependencies\n- Applying migrations in the correct order\n- Providing clear error messages for dependency issues\n\nNote that this is a simulation of migration application.

Raises `CircularDependencyError` if circular dependencies are detected\n   - Raises `MissingDependencyError` if a required migration is not found\n\n3. **Migration Simulation**:\n   - The `apply_migrations()` function simulates applying migrations\n   - Prints out each operation being applied (in a real scenario, these would be actual database operations)\n\n4. **Modularity**:\n   - The code follows the Single Responsibility Principle\n   - Each function and class has a clear, focused responsibility\n   - Loose coupling between components\n\n5. **Reusability**:\n   - The migration simulator can be easily adapted to different migration scenarios\n   - The topological sorting algorithm is generic and can be used in other dependency-resolution contexts\n\nThe test function demonstrates how to use the migration simulator with example migrations. By uncommenting the last line, you can run the test and see the migrations being applied.\n\nSome additional notes:\n- This is a simulation and doesn't actually modify a database\n- In a real Django project, the actual migration mechanism would be more complex\n- The implementation focuses on the core logic of dependency resolution and migration order\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the solution or explain the dependency resolution algorithm in more detail?", "final_score": 28.0}

The `_init_params` method has a single, clear responsibility of initializing network parameters.\n   - The method is independent and can be called separately from other methods.\n   - The code follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns.\n\n2. **Code Reusability**:\n   - The initialization method is generic and can work with different dataset sizes and configurations.\n   - The network architecture is configurable through `hidden_layers` and `activation` parameters.\n   - Common initialization logic is encapsulated in a single method.\n\n3. **Module Interface Design**:\n   - The method has a clear, intuitive interface with a single input parameter `X`.\n   - It uses descriptive variable names and follows a consistent naming convention.\n   - The implementation uses Xavier/Glorot initialization, which is a best practice for neural network weight initialization.\n\nKey implementation details:\n- Uses Xavier/Glorot initialization for weight matrices to prevent vanishing/exploding gradients\n- Dynamically determines layer dimensions based on input data\n- Initializes weights with scaled random values\n- Initializes biases as zero vectors\n- Sets `fitted_` flag to manage network state\n\nThe implementation provides a flexible and robust approach to initializing neural network parameters while maintaining clean, modular code structure.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the implementation?", "final_score": 28.333333333333332}

It ensures low coupling by keeping the time conversion logic self-contained within the class.\n\nThe `main()` function demonstrates the usage of the class, showing how to create objects, set times, and display them in the civilian format.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation or explain any specific design choices?", "final_score": 27.666666666666668}

The `onDoubleTap` method is overridden to handle the double tap gesture. When a double tap is detected, a `Toast` message is displayed.\n\n2. **Overriding `onTouchEvent`**:\n   - The `onTouchEvent` method is overridden to pass the motion events to the `GestureDetector`. This ensures that the gesture detector can process the touch events and detect gestures like double taps.\n\n3. **Double Tap Detection**:\n   - The `onDoubleTap` method in the `SimpleOnGestureListener` is triggered when a double tap is detected. Inside this method, a `Toast` message is shown to indicate that the double tap gesture has been recognized.\n\n### Usage:\n- When you run this activity and double tap on the screen, a `Toast` message saying \"Double Tap Detected!\" will appear.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the double tap gesture is accurately detected and a specific action (showing a `Toast`) is performed when the gesture is recognized.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies for Android development.\n2. Place this code in an activity class.\n3.

The method should take a keyword argument `element_type` which specifies the type of elements to be found (e.g., \"triangle\", \"quadrilateral\", \"node\", etc.). The method should return the indices of the elements of the specified type in the mesh.\n\nYou are provided with the following information:\n- The class `FrozenOnly` from the module `screws.freeze.main` is a base class for creating frozen (immutable) objects.\n- The module `root.config.main` contains a variable `sIze` which may be relevant for the implementation.\n- The class `_2dCSCG_Mesh_DO_FIND` has an attribute `_DO_` which represents the meshDO object and an attribute `_mesh_` which represents the mesh within the meshDO object.\n\nYour task is to complete the implementation of the `find_elements` method within the `_2dCSCG_Mesh_DO_FIND` class to satisfy the given requirements.", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-1", "answer": " I'll implement the `find_elements` method for the `_2dCSCG_Mesh_DO_FIND` class, focusing on creating a clean, reusable, and well-structured solution that meets the specified requirements.\n\n\n```python \nfrom screws.freeze.main import FrozenOnly\nfrom typing import Union, List, Optional\n\nclass _2dCSCG_Mesh_DO_FIND(FrozenOnly):\n    def __init__(self, meshDO):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the mesh find methods wrapper.\n        \n        :param meshDO: The mesh data object containing mesh information\n        \"\"\"\n        self._DO_ = meshDO\n        self._mesh_ = meshDO.mesh\n    \n    def find_elements(self, element_type: Optional[str] = None) -> List[int]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Find indices of elements in the mesh by specified type.\n        \n        :param element_type: Type of elements to find (e.g., 'triangle', 'quadrilateral', 'node')\n        :return: List of indices for elements of the specified type\n        \"\"\"\n        # Validate input \n        if element_type is None:\n            raise ValueError(\"Element type must be specified\")\n        \n        # Normalize element type to lowercase for consistent matching\n        element_type = element_type.lower()\n        \n        # Available element type mapping \n        element_type_map = {\n            'triangle': 'cells_triangle',\n            'quadrilateral': 'cells_quadrilateral', \n            'node': 'nodes',\n            'edge': 'boundaries'\n        }\n        \n        # Check if the requested element type is supported\n        if element_type not in element_type_map:\n            supported_types = list(element_type_map.keys())\n            raise ValueError(\n                f\"Unsupported element type '{element_type}'. \"\n                f\"Supported types are: {supported_types}\"\n            )\n        \n        # Retrieve the corresponding attribute from the mesh\n        attribute_name = element_type_map[element_type]\n        \n        try:\n            # Access the attribute dynamically \n            elements = getattr(self._mesh_, attribute_name)\n            \n            # Return indices (assuming the attribute contains indices)\n            return list(elements)\n        \n        except AttributeError:\n            raise AttributeError(\n                f\"Mesh object does not have attribute '{attribute_name}' \"\n                f\"for element type '{element_type}'\"\n            )\n\n```\n\n\nLet me break down the key design considerations for this implementation:\n\n1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: \n   - The method focuses solely on finding element indices\n   - Clear separation of concerns with input validation and element type mapping\n\n2. **Code Reusability**:\n   - Uses a flexible dictionary-based mapping for element types\n   - Generic error handling allows easy extension of supported element types\n   - Type hints and docstrings enhance usability\n\n3. **Module Interface Design**:\n   - Clear method signature with optional type parameter\n   - Intuitive naming (`find_elements`)\n   - Comprehensive error messages for unsupported types\n   - Dynamic attribute access for flexibility\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Validates input element type\n   - Provides informative error messages\n   - Handles potential attribute access errors\n\nExample usage would look like:\n```python\n# Find triangle indices\ntriangle_indices = mesh_do_find.find_elements('triangle')\n\n# Find quadrilateral indices\nquad_indices = mesh_do_find.find_elements('quadrilateral')\n```\n\nThe implementation is flexible and can be easily extended by adding more mappings to `element_type_map`.

The class design allows for easy integration into larger systems\n   - Clear, type-hinted methods promote reuse\n\n4. **Interface Design**:\n   - Clear method signatures with type hints\n   - Descriptive method and exception names\n   -

Uses `ArrayList` for flexible account storage\n   - Returns a copy of accounts list to prevent external modifications\n   - Validation methods can be easily extended or reused\n\n4. **Interface Design**:\n   - Clear, descriptive method signatures\n   - Comprehensive error handling\n   - Synchronized transfer method to prevent race conditions\n\n5. **Dependency Management**:\n   - Minimizes direct dependencies between `Bank` and `Account`\n   -

This approach is much more efficient than multiplying `x` by itself `n` times, especially for large `n`.\n\n### Example Outputs:\n- `myPow(2, 3)` returns `8` because \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n- `myPow(2, -3)` returns `0.125` because \\(2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125\\).\n- `myPow(3, 0)` returns `1` because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.\n\nThis implementation is efficient, handles edge cases, and is modular in design.", "final_score": 27.0}

Modules are loosely coupled, communicating through well-defined interfaces\n   - The design allows for easy extension and modification\n\n2. **Code Reusability**:\n   - `ConditionalEffect` is a generic, reusable class that can be applied to any object\n   - The effect system is not tied to a specific bot implementation\n   - Conditions and actions are defined as callable functions, providing maximum flexibility\n\n3. **Module Interface Design**:\n   - Clear, intuitive method names: `add_effect()`, `apply_effects()`, `remove_effect()`\n   - High cohesion within methods\n   - Low coupling between components\n   - Flexible design that supports both immediate and delayed effects\n\nKey Features:\n- Support for adding periodic tasks to bot spawners\n- Ability to apply immediate and delayed conditional effects\n- Unique ID for each effect for easy tracking and removal\n- Condition-based effect application\n- Extensible design that can be integrated into various game systems\n\nThe main method demonstrates how to use the system, showing how effects can be created, added, and applied to bots.\n\nPotential Improvements:\n- Integrate with a game loop for more precise timing of delayed effects\n- Add more robust error handling\n- Implement a more sophisticated scheduling mechanism for delayed effects\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the design or discuss potential optimizations?", "final_score": 29.0}

Additionally, you need to implement a function `calculate_total_size` that takes the organized package data and calculates the total size of all packages for a given package name.\n\nThe `organize_packages` function should have the following signature:\n```python\ndef organize_packages(packages: list) -> dict:\n    pass\n```\n\nThe `calculate_total_size` function should have the following signature:\n```python\ndef calculate_total_size(organized_packages: dict, package_name: str) -> int:\n    pass\n```\n\nExample:\nFor the input:\n```python\npackages = [\n    {\"name\": \"numpy\", \"version\": \"1.18.1\", \"dependencies\": [\"mkl\", \"python\"], \"size\": 150},\n    {\"name\": \"mkl\", \"version\": \"2019.0\", \"dependencies\": [\"python\"], \"size\": 100},\n    {\"name\": \"python\", \"version\": \"3.7.4\", \"dependencies\": [], \"size\": 200}\n]\n```\nThe output of `organize_packages(packages)` should be:\n```python\n{\n    \"numpy\": [\"1.18.1\"],\n    \"mkl\": [\"2019.0\"],\n    \"python\": [\"3.7.4\"]\n}\n```\nAnd the output of `calculate_total_size(organized_packages, \"numpy\")` should be:\n```python\n450\n```\nThis is because the total size of the \"numpy\" package and its dependencies (\"mkl\" and \"python\") is 450 (150 + 100 + 200).", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-1", "answer": " I'll solve this task by creating a modular and reusable solution that adheres to the specified requirements for code structure and design.\n\n\n```python \ndef organize_packages(packages: list) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Organize packages into a dictionary where keys are package names \n    and values are lists of versions.\n    \n    Args:\n        packages (list): List of package dictionaries.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: Organized package dictionary with package names as keys \n              and version lists as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    organized_packages = {}\n    \n    for package in packages:\n        name = package['name']\n        version = package['version']\n        \n        # Add package version to its corresponding list\n        if name not in organized_packages:\n            organized_packages[name] = []\n        \n        if version not in organized_packages[name]:\n            organized_packages[name].append(version)\n    \n    return organized_packages\n\ndef calculate_total_size(organized_packages: dict, package_name: str, packages: list, visited=None) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total size of a package including its dependencies.\n    \n    Args:\n        organized_packages (dict): Dictionary of organized packages.\n        package_name (str): Name of the package to calculate size for.\n        packages (list): Original list of package dictionaries.\n        visited (set, optional): Set to track visited packages to prevent circular dependencies.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: Total size of the package and its dependencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize visited set to track packages already processed\n    if visited is None:\n        visited = set()\n    \n    # Prevent circular dependency processing\n    if package_name in visited:\n        return 0\n    visited.add(package_name)\n    \n    # Find the package in the original packages list\n    package = next((pkg for pkg in packages if pkg['name'] == package_name), None)\n    \n    if package is None:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Calculate package size\n    total_size = package['size']\n    \n    # Recursively calculate sizes of dependencies\n    for dependency in package.get('dependencies', []):\n        total_size += calculate_total_size(organized_packages, dependency, packages, visited)\n    \n    return total_size\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    packages = [\n        {\"name\": \"numpy\", \"version\": \"1.18.1\", \"dependencies\": [\"mkl\", \"python\"], \"size\": 150},\n        {\"name\": \"mkl\", \"version\": \"2019.0\", \"dependencies\": [\"python\"], \"size\": 100},\n        {\"name\": \"python\", \"version\": \"3.7.4\", \"dependencies\": [], \"size\": 200}\n    ]\n    \n    # Organize packages\n    organized_packages = organize_packages(packages)\n    print(\"Organized Packages:\", organized_packages)\n    \n    # Calculate total size of numpy\n    total_numpy_size = calculate_total_size(organized_packages, \"numpy\", packages)\n    print(\"Total Numpy Size:\", total_numpy_size)\n\n```\n\n\nLet me explain the design decisions and how this solution meets the specified requirements:\n\n1. **Code Structure Rationality**:\n   - The code is split into two independent functions: `organize_packages` and `calculate_total_size`\n   - Each function has a single, clear responsibility\n   - The functions are loosely coupled and can be used independently\n   - The functions use clear, descriptive parameter names and have type hints\n\n2. **Code Reusability**:\n   - Both functions are designed to be generic and reusable\n   - The `calculate_total_size` function handles dependency resolution recursively\n   - The code avoids redundancy by using a single recursive function for size calculation\n   - A visited set prevents infinite recursion in case of circular dependencies\n\n3. **Module Interface Design**:\n   - Functions have clear, intuitive interfaces with well-defined input and output types\n   - Docstrings provide comprehensive documentation for each function\n   - Parameters are minimal and focused\n   - The code supports extensibility (e.g., easy to add more package information)\n\n4. **Additional Features**:\n   - Handles multiple versions of the same package\n   - Supports recursive dependency size calculation\n   - Prevents circular dependency issues\n   - Includes example usage demonstrating the functions\n\nThe solution provides a clean, modular approach to organizing and analyzing package data, meeting all the specified requirements for code structure and design.", "final_score": 29.0}

Filters are functions that transform the content of the input file in some way (e.g., minification, compression).\n- Output the bundled content to a specified file.\n\nYour program should be able to handle both JavaScript and CSS assets, and apply the appropriate filters for each type.\n\nWrite a function or class that takes input files, filters, and output file as parameters, and produces the bundled content according to the specified filters.\n\nExample:\n```python\ninput_files = {\n  \"js\": [\"libs/jQuery/dist/jquery.js\", \"app/main.js\"],\n  \"css\": [\"styles/reset.css\", \"styles/main.css\"]\n}\nfilters = {\n  \"js\": [\"uglify\"],\n  \"css\": [\"autoprefixer\", \"cssmin\"]\n}\noutput_files = {\n  \"js\": \"public/js/bundle.js\",\n  \"css\": \"public/css/bundle.css\"\n}\n\nbundle_assets(input_files, filters, output_files)\n```", "generation_model": "deepseek-chat-1", "answer": "Here's a complete and executable Python implementation of an asset bundler that supports JavaScript and CSS files with customizable filters:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Callable\n\nclass AssetBundler:\n    \"\"\"A simple asset bundler that combines and processes multiple files.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self):\n        # Define available filters for each asset type\n        self.available_filters = {\n            \"js\": {\n                \"uglify\": self._uglify_js,\n                \"strip_comments\": self._strip_js_comments\n            },\n            \"css\": {\n                \"autoprefixer\": self._autoprefix_css,\n                \"cssmin\": self._minify_css,\n                \"strip_comments\": self._strip_css_comments\n            }\n        }\n    \n    def bundle_assets(self, input_files: Dict[str, List[str]], \n                    filters: Dict[str, List[str]], \n                    output_files: Dict[str, str]) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Bundle assets with specified filters.\n        \n        Args:\n            input_files: Dictionary mapping asset types to file paths\n            filters: Dictionary mapping asset types to filter names\n            output_files: Dictionary mapping asset types to output file paths\n        \"\"\"\n        for asset_type, files in input_files.items():\n            if asset_type not in output_files:\n                continue\n                \n            # Get filters for this asset type\n            asset_filters = filters.get(asset_type, [])\n            processed_content = []\n            \n            for file_path in files:\n                try:\n                    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n                        content = f.read()\n                    \n                    # Apply filters\n                    for filter_name in asset_filters:\n                        if filter_name in self.available_filters.get(asset_type, {}):\n                            content = self.available_filters[asset_type][filter_name](content)\n                    \n                    processed_content.append(content)\n                except FileNotFoundError:\n                    print(f\"Warning: File not found -

The example usage demonstrates how to create and run a command step.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will output logging messages showing the start and completion of the command step, along with the result dictionary.", "final_score": 28.0}

While the code does eventually use `strip()` to remove the trailing space, this is not efficient and is an unnecessary operation.\n\n2. **Lack of Word Order Reversal**: This code only reverses each individual word but does not reverse the order of the words themselves.

It is a list method and does not work on strings. Instead, slicing (`[::-1]`) should be used to reverse a string.\n2. **`reversed_words.reverse()`**: The `reverse()` method reverses the list in place and returns `None`. This will cause an error when trying to join the list into a string.\n3. **No Exception Handling**: The function does not handle potential exceptions, such as passing a non-string input.\n\n### Corrected Code:\nTo fix the erroneous code, replace the incorrect methods with the correct ones and add exception handling:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words_and_string_fixed(input_string):\n    try:\n        # Split the string into words\n        words = input_string.split()\n        \n        # Reverse each word\n        reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]\n        \n        # Reverse the order of the words\n        reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words[::-1])\n        \n        return reversed_string\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"An error occurred: {e}\"\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = 'Artificial Intelligence'\noutput = reverse_words_and_string_fixed(input_string)\nprint(output)  # Output: 'ecnegilletnI laicifitrA'\n```\n\n### Key Fixes:\n1. Use slicing (`[::-1]`) to reverse strings.\n2. Avoid using `reverse()` on lists when joining them into a string.\n3. Add exception handling to make the function robust.", "final_score": 21.666666666666668}

`BracketMatcher` is independent and can be easily reused across different contexts\n   - The class uses class methods, making it stateless and highly reusable\n   - Bracket handling logic is completely separated from the main function\n\n3. **Code Reusability**:\n   - `BRACKET_PAIRS` dictionary allows easy extension to support more bracket types\n   - Methods like `is_opening_bracket`, `is_closing_bracket`, and `get_matching_bracket` are generic and can be used in various scenarios\n   - The implementation eliminates redundant code by centralizing bracket-matching logic\n\n4. **Interface Clarity**:\n   - Clear type hints for all methods\n   - Comprehensive docstrings explaining the purpose and behavior of each method\n   - Intuitive method names that clearly describe their functionality\n\n5. **Error Handling and Flexibility**:\n   - Added error handling for invalid bracket inputs\n   - Supports multiple bracket types (round, square, curly)\n   - Handles nested and complex bracket configurations\n\nKey Improvements:\n- Modular design with clear separation of concerns\n- Easy to extend and maintain\n- Supports multiple bracket types\n- Provides clear, reusable methods for bracket manipulation\n\nThe implementation follows best practices for code modularity, making it easy to understand, extend, and maintain.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of the implementation or discuss the modularity principles in more detail?", "final_score": 29.0}

Make sure you have the `pdblp` library installed and a Bloomberg terminal running.\n\n```python\nimport pdblp\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Connect to Bloomberg\ncon = pdblp.BCon(debug=False, port=8194, timeout=5000)\ncon.start()\n\n# Retrieve minute-by-minute data for a specific security (e.g., AAPL US Equity)\n# The start and end times need to be specified in the format of 'YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS'\nstart_date = '20230101 09:30:00'\nend_date = '20230101 16:00:00'\nticker = 'AAPL US Equity'\n\n# Fetch minute-by-minute data\ndata = con.bdib(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date, interval='1', fields='PX_LAST')\n\n# Convert the data into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame\nprint(df.head())\n\n# Stop the Bloomberg connection\ncon.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Connecting to Bloomberg**: It establishes a connection to the Bloomberg terminal.\n2. **Fetching Data**: It uses `bldib`, specifying the ticker symbol, start and end times, and the interval for minute data.\n3. **DataFrame Creation**: The returned data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.\n4. **Output**: It prints the first few rows of the DataFrame to verify the fetched data.\n\nMake sure to replace the ticker symbol and time range with your desired inputs.

The code is organized with clear separation of concerns.\n\n2. **Code Reusability**:\n   - The function is generic and can handle both integers and floating-point numbers.\n   - It's designed to be easily imported and used in different contexts.\n   - Common functionality is encapsulated within a single function.\n\n3. **Module Interface Design**:\n   - The function has a clear, intuitive interface with a single input parameter.\n   - It returns a structured dictionary with peaks and valleys, making it easy to use.\n   - Each returned peak/valley entry contains comprehensive information (value, index, previous and next values).\n\n**Key Features**:\n- Handles various edge cases (empty lists, short lists, sorted lists)\n- O(n) time complexity\n- O(n) space complexity\n- Detailed test cases covering multiple scenarios\n- Supports both integers and floating-point numbers\n- Preserves original order and positions of peaks and valleys\n\nThe comprehensive test cases demonstrate the function's robustness across different input types and scenarios. The code follows best practices in Python, with clear documentation, type hints, and a focus on readability and maintainability.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of the implementation?", "final_score": 28.333333333333332}

Instead, it tries to return the payload directly, which could lead to incorrect outputs if the structure is nested.\n3. **Assumption of Payload**: The code assumes that the payload can be returned directly as a string without considering decoding requirements or character set handling.\n\n### Rectification\n\nTo rectify the erroneous code:\n- Implement actual decryption logic for both PGP and S/MIME.\n- Use recursion to properly navigate all nested parts of the MIME structure.\n- Ensure proper character set decoding when retrieving payloads. \n\nBy addressing these issues, the function can be made more robust and capable of handling complex encrypted email structures effectively.", "final_score": 24.333333333333332}

Separated `Node` and `SinglyLinkedList` classes for clear separation of concerns\n   - Added docstrings for clear documentation\n   - Implemented a `main()` function to demonstrate usage\n   - Added error handling for invalid operations\n\n2. **Module Independence**:\n   - Each method has a single, clear responsibility\n   - Methods are independent and can be used without side effects\n   - Added an `is_empty()` method to simplify checks\n\n3. **Improved Implementation Details**:\n   - Removed the dummy head node, which was unnecessary\n   - Added proper position validation\n   - Implemented more robust error handling\n   - Improved the `reverse_list()` method with clearer variable names\n   - Enhanced `display_list()` to return a list instead of printing directly\n\n4. **Code Reusability**:\n   - Methods are generic and can be easily integrated into other projects\n   - Clear, consistent method naming\n   - Minimal dependencies between methods\n\n5. **Interface Design**:\n   - Intuitive method names\n   - Clear parameter lists\n   - Comprehensive error handling\n   - Consistent return types\n\nCompared to the original implementation, this version:\n- Handles edge cases more robustly\n- Provides more informative error messages\n- Follows Python naming conventions (snake_case)\n- Offers more flexibility in list operations\n- Includes a demonstration of usage\n\nThe code is now more modular, readable, and maintainable. Each method has a single responsibility, and the code is structured to be easily understood and extended.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation or discuss the modularity principles applied?", "final_score": 29.0}

This was removed to allow matching URLs anywhere in the text.\n\n2. **Handling Multiple Protocols**:\n   - Added support for `ftp://` in addition to `http://` and `https://`.\n\n3. **Improved URL Extraction**:\n   - The `re.findall` function returns a list of tuples (one for each capturing group). The corrected code joins these tuples into a single string for each URL.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The function now handles URLs with or without protocols, subdomains, ports, paths, and query strings.\n\n### Test Output:\nFor the provided `test_text`, the output will be:\n```\n[\n    'http://www.example.com', \n    'https://example.com', \n    'ftp://ftp.example.com', \n    'www.example.org', \n    'example.com', \n    'http://localhost:8080/path/to/resource', \n    'https://www.example.co.uk/path?query=param#fragment'\n]\n```\n\nThis solution is efficient, handles various edge cases, and accurately extracts URLs from text.", "final_score": 23.0}

Robust error handling in each method using try-except blocks\n   - `safely_convert_to_ascii()` method provides graceful error management for ASCII conversion\n   - Prints descriptive error messages without halting program execution\n   - Handles out-of-range values explicitly (like the 1024 in the original example)\n\n3. **List Generation**:\n   - `generate_printable_chars_reversed()` creates a reversed list of printable ASCII characters\n   - `generate_non_printable_chars_hex()` generates non-printable characters in hexadecimal\n   - `merge_ascii_lists()` combines these lists in an alternative order\n\n4. **Flexibility and Reusability**:\n   - Methods are designed to be generic and reusable\n   - The `main()` function demonstrates how to use the class methods\n   - Easy to extend or modify without affecting other parts of the code\n\n5. **Demonstration of Capabilities**:\n   - The code shows safe ASCII conversion for various input values\n   - Handles valid and invalid ASCII conversions gracefully\n\nThe solution goes beyond the original example by providing a comprehensive, modular approach to ASCII character processing that is robust, clear, and maintainable.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the code or its design?", "final_score": 28.333333333333332}

`LambdaCleanupManager` class encapsulates all Lambda cleanup logic\n   - Separate methods for listing, checking, and deleting functions\n   - Clear separation of concerns between function identification and deletion\n\n2. **Error Handling**:\n   - Comprehensive exception handling for AWS API calls\n   - Granular logging at different levels (info, warning, error)\n   - Handles potential issues like function not found or metric retrieval problems\n\n3. **Modularity**:\n   - Configurable parameters like region, idle threshold, and logging level\n   - `dry_run` mode allows safe exploration of potential deletions\n   - Methods are designed to be easily testable and reusable\n\n4. **Flexibility**:\n   - Uses AWS boto3 pagination to handle large numbers of Lambda functions\n   - Checks function idleness based on CloudWatch invocation metrics\n   - Allows easy customization of idle function detection criteria\n\nKey features:\n- Identifies Lambda functions idle for more than a specified number of days\n- Supports dry run mode for safe exploration\n- Comprehensive error handling and logging\n- Modular and configurable design\n\nNote: Before running this script, ensure you:\n1. Have boto3 installed (`pip install boto3`)\n2. Configured AWS credentials\n3. Have appropriate IAM permissions for Lambda and CloudWatch operations\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of the script or discuss its design principles further?", "final_score": 27.666666666666668}

The function returns a tuple with:\n   - The number of segments (length of `segments`)\n   - The list of unique character counts for each segment\n\nLet's verify it works with the given test cases:\n\n```python\n# Test cases\nprint(segment_and_unique_chars(\"Hello, my name is John\"))  # (5, [6, 2, 4, 2, 4])\nprint(segment_and_unique_chars(\"Hello\"))  # (1, [5])\nprint(segment_and_unique_chars(\"love live! mu'sic forever\"))  # (4, [4, 5, 6, 7])\nprint(segment_and_unique_chars(\"\"))  # (0, [])\n```\n\nKey improvements over the original code:\n- Handles empty string case correctly\n- Uses `set()` to count unique characters, which works for all character types\n- Correctly splits segments using `split()`\n- Returns the exact tuple format specified in the problem description\n\nThe solution meets all the requirements:\n- Works with 0 <= s.length <= 300\n- Handles lower-case and upper-case English letters\n- Includes digits and specified punctuation marks\n- Correctly counts unique characters in each segment\n\nTime Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string\nSpace Complexity: O(n) to store the segments and unique character sets", "final_score": 26.666666666666668}

This often results in better discrimination between classes.\n  - The linear discriminants can be interpreted in terms of the original features and can provide insight into the features that contribute to class separation.\n- **Cons**:\n  - LDA requires that the classes are normally distributed and have the same covariance matrix, which may not always be the case.\n  - If the number of classes exceeds the number of features, LDA may not be able to provide enough linear discriminants (it can only produce at most \\(C-1\\) discriminants, where \\(C\\) is the number of classes).\n\nIn the context of the Iris dataset, LDA is often preferred if the goal is to achieve the best class separation since it is designed to do so.

LDA is superior for class separation but relies on specific assumptions about the data distribution.

Functions within modules should accept parameters that define their behavior and return results clearly.\n\n4. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Implement the input module to capture a string from the user.\n   - Implement the disassembly module to take the string and break it down into individual components using built-in Python functions.\n   - Implement the output module to print the results to the user.\n\n### Executable Code Snippet\n\nHere is a complete and executable Python code snippet that embodies the above methodology:\n\n```python\ndef get_input():\n    \"\"\"Input Module: Captures user input.\"\"\"\n    user_input = input(\"Enter a string to disassemble: \")\n    return user_input\n\ndef disassemble_string(input_string, delimiter=None):\n    \"\"\"Disassembly Module: Breaks down the string into individual components.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The string to disassemble.\n        delimiter (str, optional): The delimiter to split the string.

If a delimiter is provided, it splits the string based on that; otherwise, it converts the string into a list of characters.\n- **`output_results(components)`**: This function takes a list of components and prints each one to the console.\n- **`main()`**: This function brings all modules together, orchestrating the input, disassembly, and output processes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis structured approach ensures that each aspect of the disassembly process is encapsulated in its own module, promoting clear separation of concerns, high reusability, and maintainability.

However, there are a few issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Use of `std::remove_copy_if`**: The `std::remove_copy_if` function copies elements from the source range (`s.begin()` to `s.end()`) to the destination (`result.begin()`) that do **not** satisfy the predicate (`is_special`). However, the destination (`result`) is initialized as a copy of `s`, which means it already contains all characters, including special ones. The `remove_copy_if` will overwrite the beginning of `result` with non-special characters, but the rest of the string will remain unchanged, leading to incorrect output.\n\n2. **String Length Issue**: The `result` string retains its original length after `remove_copy_if`, which means trailing characters (including special ones) may still appear in the output.\n\n3. **Predicate Logic**: The `is_special` function correctly identifies non-alphabetic characters, but the overall logic of the function needs adjustment.\n\n### Corrected Code ###\n\nTo fix these issues, we can:\n1. Use `std::remove_if` with `erase` to modify the string in place, or\n2. Use `std::copy_if` to copy only the desired characters to a new string.\n\nHere’s the corrected version using `std::copy_if`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <iterator>\n\nbool is_not_alpha(char c) {\n    return !isalpha(c) && !isspace(c); // Keep spaces if needed, otherwise remove this condition\n}\n\nstd::string remove_special_characters(std::string s) {\n    std::string result;\n    std::copy_if(s.begin(), s.end(), std::back_inserter(result),\n                 [](char c) { return isalpha(c) || isspace(c); }); // Keep letters and spaces\n    return result;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string str = \"Hello!&@ This#%^$ is a string\";\n    std::string result = remove_special_characters(str);\n    std::cout << result << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes ###\n\n1. **Predicate Adjustment**: The lambda function `[](char c) { return isalpha(c) || isspace(c); }` is used to copy only alphabetic characters and spaces. If spaces should also be removed, modify the lambda to `[](char c) { return isalpha(c); }`.\n\n2. **`std::copy_if` with `back_inserter`**: This ensures that only the desired characters are copied into `result`, and `result` is correctly sized without trailing garbage.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: This approach avoids unnecessary copying or resizing of the string.\n\n### Output ###\nFor the input `\"Hello!&@ This#%^$ is a string\"`, the output will be:\n```\nHello This is a string\n```\n\nIf you want to remove spaces as well, modify the lambda to exclude `isspace(c)`.

However, there are two main issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Use of `std::remove_copy_if`**: The function `std::remove_copy_if` does not resize the output string. It only copies the non-special characters to the beginning of `result` but leaves the rest of the string unchanged. This results in trailing garbage characters in the output.\n\n2. **Space Handling**: The code does not explicitly handle spaces, but the example input contains spaces. Depending on requirements, spaces may or may not be considered special characters. For this task, we will treat spaces as special characters (non-alphabetic) and remove them.\n\n### Corrected Code ###\n\nHere is the corrected and fully executable code that properly removes all non-alphabetic characters (including spaces):\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nbool is_special(char c) {\n    return !isalpha(c);\n}\n\nstd::string remove_special_characters(std::string s) {\n    // Use erase-remove idiom to remove special characters\n    s.erase(std::remove_if(s.begin(), s.end(), is_special), s.end());\n    return s;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string str = \"Hello!&@ This#%^$ is a string\";\n    std::string result = remove_special_characters(str);\n    std::cout << result << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Improvements ###\n\n1. **Erase-Remove Idiom**: The corrected code uses the `erase-remove` idiom, which is the standard way to remove elements from a container in C++. \n   - `std::remove_if` moves all non-special characters to the front of the string and returns an iterator to the new logical end.\n   - `s.erase` then truncates the string from this new end to the original end, effectively removing the unwanted characters.\n\n2. **Correct Output**: The output will now be `\"HelloThisisastring\"`, with all non-alphabetic characters (including spaces and punctuation) removed.\n\n### Alternative Version (Keep Spaces) ###\nIf spaces should be retained (not treated as special characters), modify the `is_special` function as follows:\n```cpp\nbool is_special(char c) {\n    return !isalpha(c) && !isspace(c);\n}\n```\nThis will output `\"Hello This is a string\"`.

Additionally, after using `std::remove_copy_if`, the result needs to be properly resized to reflect the new length of the string, as `remove_copy_if` does not actually shrink the size of the string.\n\nHere’s the corrected version of the code to remove all special characters from the input string in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nbool is_special(char c) {\n    return !isalpha(c); // Check if the character is not an alphabet\n}\n\nstd::string remove_special_characters(const std::string& s) {\n    std::string result;\n    // Use std::copy_if to copy only the alphabetic characters\n    std::copy_if(s.begin(), s.end(), std::back_inserter(result), [](char c) {\n        return isalpha(c); // Keep only alphabetic characters\n    });\n    return result; // Return the modified string\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string str = \"Hello!&@ This#%^$ is a string\";\n    std::string result = remove_special_characters(str);\n    std::cout << result << std::endl; // Output: HelloThisastring\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Modifications Made:\n1. **Use of `std::copy_if`**: Instead of `std::remove_copy_if`, I utilized `std::copy_if` along with `std::back_inserter` to create a new string containing only alphabetic characters.\n2. **Lambda Function**: A lambda function is used directly inside `std::copy_if` to check if each character is alphabetic.\n3. **String Construction**: The `result` string is built directly with the alphabetic characters, which makes the code cleaner and more efficient.\n\n### Output:\nThe output of the above program will be:\n```\nHelloThisastring\n```\n\nThis program now effectively removes all special characters, ensuring that only alphabetic characters remain in the resulting string.", "final_score": 23.666666666666668}

Implement two additional parameters, `validate` and `format_output`. The `validate` parameter will check the input integrity comprehensively, while `format_output` renders the output in a user-friendly way. `format_output` when set true, will arrange the Roman Numerals into bracketed groups (like 'viiii' to '(v)iiii'.
