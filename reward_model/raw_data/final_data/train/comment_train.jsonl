If not, it raises an `HTTPException` with a 403 status code and the detail \"unsupported authorization type\".\n   - If both checks pass, the function returns the extracted token.\n\n3. **Edge Cases and Exception Handling**:\n   - The function handles cases where the authorization header is missing or in an invalid format by raising an appropriate `HTTPException`.\n   - It also ensures that the token prefix is correct, raising an exception if it is not.\n\n4. **Comment Density**:\n   - The comments are concise and provide clear explanations for each step of the logic, ensuring that the code is easy to understand and maintain.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function adheres to the specified requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.", "final_score": 28.0}

It also includes error handling for invalid inputs.\n- **Cleanup**: The program ensures that GPIO settings are cleaned up when the user exits the program.\n\nThis code is designed to be executed on a Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller setup that supports GPIO operations.

The function should return the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling the stock at most once.\n\nExample:\nInput:\nprices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]\nOutput:\n5\nExplanation:\nIn this case, the maximum profit can be obtained by buying the stock on day 2 (price = 1) and selling it on day 5 (price = 6), resulting in a profit of 5.\n\nInput:\nprices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]\nOutput:\n0\nExplanation:\nIn this case, it is not possible to make any profit as the stock prices are continuously decreasing.", "generation_model": "deepseek-chat-1", "answer": "```python\ndef maxProfit(prices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling a stock at most once.\n\n    Args:\n        prices (List[int]): A list of integers representing the stock prices on different days.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The maximum profit that can be obtained. If no profit can be made, returns 0.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])\n        5\n        >>> maxProfit([7, 6, 4, 3, 1])\n        0\n    \"\"\"\n    if not prices:\n        return 0\n\n    min_price = float('inf')  # Initialize the minimum price to a very large value\n    max_profit = 0  # Initialize the maximum profit to 0\n\n    for price in prices:\n        # Update the minimum price if the current price is lower\n        if price < min_price:\n            min_price = price\n        # Calculate the potential profit if we sell at the current price\n        elif price - min_price > max_profit:\n            max_profit = price - min_price\n\n    return max_profit\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We start by initializing `min_price` to a very large value (`float('inf')`) and `max_profit` to 0. This ensures that any price in the list will be smaller than the initial `min_price`.\n- **Iteration**: We iterate through the list of prices:\n  - If the current price is less than `min_price`, we update `min_price` to the current price. This represents the lowest price at which we can buy the stock.\n  - If the difference between the current price and `min_price` is greater than `max_profit`, we update `max_profit`. This represents the maximum profit we can achieve by selling the stock at the current price.\n- **Return**: Finally, we return `max_profit`, which holds the maximum profit that can be obtained. If no profit can be made, it will remain 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only traverse the list once, making the algorithm efficient with a time complexity of O(n).", "final_score": 28.0}

This simulates a multi-threaded environment where the `invokeCallbacks` method is called concurrently by multiple threads.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - The output will show that the callbacks are invoked multiple times, and the order of invocation may vary due to the parallel nature of the execution.

Otherwise, it returns the value in `dp[amount]`, which is the minimum number of coins needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and easy to understand, with a time complexity of `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the amount and `m` is the number of coin denominations.", "final_score": 25.0}

It checks for valid hour (1 to 12) and minute (0 to 59) inputs and updates the `isPM` boolean based on the provided flag.\n- **displayTime**: This function converts the hour from a 12-hour format to a more human-readable format, ensuring that 12 AM is displayed as `12` and 12 PM remains `12`. It then formats the output using `std::setw` and `std::setfill` to ensure proper zero-padding for single-digit hours and minutes.\n- **Example Usage**: The main function demonstrates how to use the `CivilianTimeImp` class by setting and displaying time.", "final_score": 24.0}

Finally, we return the `altered_fields` dictionary.\n\nHere's a test case to demonstrate the function:\n\n```python\nimport django.db.migrations.operations as migrations\n\n# Example input\noperations = [\n    ('api', '0022_auto_20190823_1553'),\n    migrations.AlterField(\n        model_name='loan',\n        name='loan_period',\n        field=models.FloatField(default=0.0),\n    ),\n    migrations.AlterField(\n        model_name='loan',\n        name='interest_rate',\n        field=models.FloatField(default=0.0),\n    ),\n    migrations.AlterField(\n        model_name='customer',\n        name='age',\n        field=models.IntegerField(default=0),\n    ),\n]\n\nmodels = [\n    ('api', '0022_auto_20190823_1553'),\n    ('loan', '0022_auto_20190823_1553'),\n    ('customer', '0022_auto_20190823_1553'),\n]\n\n# Call the function\nresult = process_migration_operations(operations, models)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation handles the following scenarios:\n- Multiple `AlterField` operations for the same model\n- Models with no altered fields\n- Metadata entries in the operations and models lists\n\nThe function is flexible and can handle various migration operation scenarios while maintaining a clean and readable implementation.\n\nKey points to note:\n- Uses `hasattr()` to safely check for operation attributes\n- Dynamically builds the dictionary of altered fields\n- Handles cases where a model might have multiple altered fields\n- Ignores non-`AlterField` operations\n\nTime complexity: O(n), where n is the number of operations\nSpace complexity: O(m), where m is the number of unique models with altered fields", "final_score": 25.333333333333332}

The method iterates through these pairs and invokes the `modify_setting` helper function to update the configuration content.\n- **Writing Back**: After modifications, the new content is written back to the same configuration file. Errors during writing are also handled.\n- **Modify Setting**: The `modify_setting` function checks if the specified key exists, modifies it if found, or appends it to the content if not found.\n\nThis implementation provides a clear and structured way to patch a configuration file, ensuring that any necessary updates are smoothly handled.", "final_score": 26.333333333333332}

Additionally, you need to implement a method to calculate the kinetic energy of an object based on its mass and velocity.\n\nCreate a class `MaterialInfo` with the following specifications:\n- A `float` member variable `mass` to store the mass of the material.\n- A `float` member variable `restitution` to store the restitution coefficient of the material.\n- A `float` member variable `angular_damping` to store the angular damping factor of the material.\n- A method `setMass(float mass)` to set the mass of the material.\n- A method `setRestitution(float restitution)` to set the restitution coefficient of the material.\n- A method `setAngularDamping(float damping)` to set the angular damping factor of the material.\n- A method `getKineticEnergy(float velocity)` that takes the velocity of an object as input and returns the kinetic energy based on the mass and velocity using the formula: kinetic energy = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2.\n\nYou should demonstrate the usage of the `MaterialInfo` class by setting the material properties and calculating the kinetic energy for an object with a given velocity.", "generation_model": "deepseek-chat-2", "answer": "```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\n// Class to represent material properties in a physics system\nclass MaterialInfo {\nprivate:\n    float mass;             // Mass of the material (in kilograms)\n    float restitution;     // Restitution coefficient (bounciness)\n    float angular_damping; // Angular damping factor (resistance to rotation)\n\npublic:\n    // Default constructor initializes properties to zero\n    MaterialInfo() : mass(0.0f), restitution(0.0f), angular_damping(0.0f) {}\n\n    // Method to set the mass of the material\n    void setMass(float mass) {\n        this->mass = mass;\n    }\n\n    // Method to set the restitution coefficient of the material\n    void setRestitution(float restitution) {\n        this->restitution = restitution;\n    }\n\n    // Method to set the angular damping factor of the material\n    void setAngularDamping(float damping) {\n        this->angular_damping = damping;\n    }\n\n    // Method to calculate the kinetic energy of an object\n    // Formula: kinetic energy = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2\n    float getKineticEnergy(float velocity) {\n        return 0.5f * mass * velocity * velocity;\n    }\n\n    // Optional: Getters for material properties (not required in the task but useful)\n    float getMass() const { return mass; }\n    float getRestitution() const { return restitution; }\n    float getAngularDamping() const { return angular_damping; }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    // Create a MaterialInfo object\n    MaterialInfo material;\n\n    // Set material properties\n    material.setMass(10.0f);          // Mass of 10 kg\n    material.setRestitution(0.5f);    // Restitution coefficient of 0.5\n    material.setAngularDamping(0.1f); // Angular damping factor of 0.1\n\n    // Calculate kinetic energy for an object with a velocity of 5 m/s\n    float velocity = 5.0f;\n    float kineticEnergy = material.getKineticEnergy(velocity);\n\n    // Output the results\n    std::cout << \"Material Properties:\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Mass: \" << material.getMass() << \" kg\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Restitution: \" << material.getRestitution() << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Angular Damping: \" << material.getAngularDamping() << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Kinetic Energy at \" << velocity << \" m/s: \" << kineticEnergy << \" J\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Class `MaterialInfo`**:\n   - Contains member variables `mass`, `restitution`, and `angular_damping` to store material properties.\n   - Provides methods to set these properties (`setMass`, `setRestitution`, `setAngularDamping`).\n   - Implements `getKineticEnergy` to calculate kinetic energy using the formula `0.5 * mass * velocity^2`.\n\n2. **Main Function**:\n   - Demonstrates the usage of the `MaterialInfo` class by setting material properties and calculating kinetic energy for an object with a given velocity.\n   - Outputs the material properties and the calculated kinetic energy.\n\nThis code is complete, executable, and adheres to the task requirements.", "final_score": 27.0}

The `value` variable is a bitfield representing the status register, and the `GS_CLEAR_STS` bit is used to clear the status register when set.\n\nYour task is to implement the `HandleInterrupt` function, which should handle the interrupt request and update the status register based on the provided `value` and `GS_CLEAR_STS` bit.\n\nWrite a function with the following signature:\n```cpp\nvoid HandleInterrupt(int value, bool irqAsserted, int& statusRegister, int& index);\n```\nwhere:\n- `value` (int): The bitfield representing the status register.\n- `irqAsserted` (bool): Indicates whether the interrupt request line is asserted.\n- `statusRegister` (int&): Reference to the status register, which should be updated based on the `value` and `GS_CLEAR_STS` bit.\n- `index` (int&): Reference to the index, which should be updated based on the `value` and `GS_CLEAR_STS` bit.\n\nEnsure that the function updates the `statusRegister` and `index` according to the rules specified in the code snippet.", "generation_model": "deepseek-chat-2", "answer": "```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\n// Define the GS_CLEAR_STS bit position\nconst int GS_CLEAR_STS = 0x01; // Assuming GS_CLEAR_STS is the least significant bit\n\n// Simulated ISR handler class\nclass IRQHandler {\npublic:\n    void Handle(int index) {\n        std::cout << \"ISR called with index: \" << index << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n\n// Global IRQ handler instance\nIRQHandler* m_irq = new IRQHandler();\n\nvoid HandleInterrupt(int value, bool irqAsserted, int& statusRegister, int& index) {\n    // Check if the interrupt request line is asserted\n    if (irqAsserted) {\n        // Call the ISR with the provided index\n        m_irq->Handle(index);\n    }\n\n    // Update the status register based on the provided value\n    statusRegister = value;\n\n    // Check if the GS_CLEAR_STS bit is set in the value\n    if (value & GS_CLEAR_STS) {\n        // Clear the status register by resetting it to 0\n        statusRegister = 0;\n\n        // Update the index based on the GS_CLEAR_STS bit\n        index = 0; // Assuming index should be reset when GS_CLEAR_STS is set\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Example usage of the HandleInterrupt function\n    int statusRegister = 0x0F; // Initial status register value\n    int index = 5; // Initial index value\n    bool irqAsserted = true; // Simulate an asserted IRQ line\n\n    // Call HandleInterrupt with a value that has GS_CLEAR_STS bit set\n    HandleInterrupt(0x01, irqAsserted, statusRegister, index);\n\n    // Output the updated status register and index\n    std::cout << \"Updated Status Register: \" << statusRegister << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Updated Index: \" << index << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **IRQ Handling**:\n   - The function first checks if the `irqAsserted` flag is true. If it is, the ISR is invoked by calling `m_irq->Handle(index)`.\n\n2. **Status Register Update**:\n   - The `statusRegister` is updated with the provided `value`. This reflects the current state of the status register after the interrupt.\n\n3. **GS_CLEAR_STS Bit Handling**:\n   - If the `GS_CLEAR_STS` bit is set in the `value`, the `statusRegister` is cleared (set to 0), and the `index` is reset to 0. This simulates the clearing of the status register and resetting of the index when the `GS_CLEAR_STS` bit is active.\n\n4. **Main Function**:\n   - The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `HandleInterrupt` function. It initializes the `statusRegister` and `index`, simulates an asserted IRQ line, and then calls `HandleInterrupt` with a value that has the `GS_CLEAR_STS` bit set. The updated values of `statusRegister` and `index` are printed to the console.\n\nThis code snippet is fully executable and demonstrates the interrupt handling logic as described.", "final_score": 25.0}

If a package name appears multiple times, its versions are collected in a list.\n- The `calculate_total_size` function computes the total size of a package, including its dependencies. It maintains a dictionary that maps each package name to its size and dependencies. A nested helper function `_calculate_size` recursively aggregates the sizes of a package and its dependencies, ensuring all required sizes are incorporated.\n- The script concludes with an example usage that demonstrates both functions in action, printing the organized structure and the computed total size for the \"numpy\" package.", "final_score": 28.666666666666668}

Filters are functions that transform the content of the input file in some way (e.g., minification, compression).\n- Output the bundled content to a specified file.\n\nYour program should be able to handle both JavaScript and CSS assets, and apply the appropriate filters for each type.\n\nWrite a function or class that takes input files, filters, and output file as parameters, and produces the bundled content according to the specified filters.\n\nExample:\n```python\ninput_files = {\n  \"js\": [\"libs/jQuery/dist/jquery.js\", \"app/main.js\"],\n  \"css\": [\"styles/reset.css\", \"styles/main.css\"]\n}\nfilters = {\n  \"js\": [\"uglify\"],\n  \"css\": [\"autoprefixer\", \"cssmin\"]\n}\noutput_files = {\n  \"js\": \"public/js/bundle.js\",\n  \"css\": \"public/css/bundle.css\"\n}\n\nbundle_assets(input_files, filters, output_files)\n```", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-2", "answer": "Here's a comprehensive implementation of an asset bundler in Python:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport re\n\nclass AssetBundler:\n    \"\"\"\n    A flexible asset bundling class for web development projects.\n    \n    This class provides functionality to bundle JavaScript and CSS assets\n    with customizable filtering and transformation capabilities.\n    \n    Attributes:\n        input_files (dict): Dictionary of input files by asset type\n        filters (dict): Filters to apply to each asset type\n        output_files (dict): Destination files for bundled assets\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, input_files, filters, output_files):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the AssetBundler with input files, filters, and output destinations.\n        \n        Args:\n            input_files (dict): Dictionary mapping asset types to file paths\n            filters (dict): Dictionary of filter names for each asset type\n            output_files (dict): Dictionary mapping asset types to output file paths\n        \"\"\"\n        self.input_files = input_files\n        self.filters = filters\n        self.output_files = output_files\n    \n    def _read_file(self, filepath):\n        \"\"\"\n        Read the contents of a file.\n        \n        Args:\n            filepath (str): Path to the file to be read\n        \n        Returns:\n            str: File contents\n        \n        Raises:\n            FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            with open(filepath, 'r') as file:\n                return file.read()\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            print(f\"Warning: File {filepath} not found.\")\n            return \"\"\n    \n    def _apply_filters(self, content, asset_type):\n        \"\"\"\n        Apply specified filters to the asset content.\n        \n        Args:\n            content (str): Original file content\n            asset_type (str): Type of asset (js or css)\n        \n        Returns:\n            str: Filtered content\n        \"\"\"\n        #

The simulated filters demonstrate basic transformation techniques, which can be replaced with actual minification libraries in a production environment.\n\nKey improvements over a basic implementation include:\n- Comprehensive error handling\n- Flexible filter application\n- Clear separation of concerns\n- Detailed documentation\n\nNote: This is a simulation and would require actual minification libraries (like UglifyJS, cssnano) for production use.", "final_score": 28.666666666666668}

The method signature is as follows:\n\n```java\n@Inject(method = \"randomTick\", at = @At(\"TAIL\"), cancellable = true)\npublic void cancelRandomTick(BlockState state, ServerWorld world, BlockPos pos, Random random, CallbackInfo ci) {\n    repeat = true;\n}\n```\n\nYour task is to complete the method implementation to achieve the following behavior:\n- If the block at the given position (`pos`) meets certain criteria, the random tick for that block should be canceled.\n- If the random tick is canceled, set the `repeat` variable to `true` to indicate that the random tick should not occur for this block.\n\nYour goal is to implement the logic inside the `cancelRandomTick` method to achieve the desired behavior of canceling the random tick for specific blocks based on their state, world, and position.\n\nWrite the logic inside the `cancelRandomTick` method to achieve the described behavior.", "generation_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2", "answer": "Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `cancelRandomTick` method that cancels the random tick for a block based on specific criteria related to its state and position. This example assumes we want to cancel the random tick for blocks that are of a certain type (e.g., `Blocks.GRASS`) and are affected by a specific condition (e.g., being adjacent to a water block).\n\n```java\n@Inject(method = \"randomTick\", at = @At(\"TAIL\"), cancellable = true)\npublic void cancelRandomTick(BlockState state, ServerWorld world, BlockPos pos, Random random, CallbackInfo ci) {\n    // Check if the block is of a specific type that we want to control the random tick behavior for\n    if (state.getBlock() == Blocks.GRASS) {\n        // Check if the block below is water (this is a condition for canceling the random tick)\n        BlockState belowState = world.getBlockState(pos.down());\n        if (belowState.getBlock() == Blocks.WATER) {\n            // If the conditions are met, cancel the random tick for this block\n            ci.cancel();  // This stops further processing of the random tick\n            repeat = true; // Indicate that the random tick should not occur for this block\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Logic:\n1. **Block Type Check**: The method first checks if the block state corresponds to a specific block type (`Blocks.GRASS` in this case). This is the condition under which we want to manipulate the random tick behavior.\n   \n2. **Adjacent Block Condition**: The method retrieves the block state directly below the current block position (`pos.down()`) and checks if it is water (`Blocks.WATER`). This additional condition is used to determine whether to cancel the random tick.\n\n3. **Canceling the Tick**: If both conditions are satisfied, the method calls `ci.cancel()`, which stops any further processing of the random tick for this block. The `repeat` variable is then set to `true`, indicating that the random tick should not occur for this specific block.\n\nThis implementation effectively controls the random tick behavior for specific blocks based on defined conditions, enhancing the mod's functionality.", "final_score": 26.666666666666668}

Your goal is to complete the implementation of the `train` function, which takes the category tensor, line tensor, RNN model, loss criterion, and optimizer as input and trains the RNN model.\n\nThe `train` function has the following signature:\n```python\ndef train(category_tensor, line_tensor, rnn, criterion, optimizer):\n    hidden = rnn.initHidden()\n    for i in range(line_tensor.size()[0]):\n        output, hidden = rnn(line_tensor[i], hidden)\n```\n\nYou need to complete the implementation of the `train` function by incorporating the necessary steps for training the RNN model using the provided inputs.\n\nYour task is to fill in the missing parts of the `train` function to properly train the RNN model using the given inputs.", "generation_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2", "answer": "To complete the implementation of the `train` function for a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) for text classification, we need to follow a sequence of steps. These steps include processing each character in the input line tensor, calculating the loss, performing backpropagation, and updating the model parameters using the optimizer. Below is the complete and executable code snippet for the `train` function:\n\n```python\ndef train(category_tensor, line_tensor, rnn, criterion, optimizer):\n    # Initialize the hidden state of the RNN\n    hidden = rnn.initHidden()\n    \n    # Zero the gradients from the previous iteration\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    \n    # Initialize the output variable to hold the final output from the RNN\n    output = None\n    \n    # Process each character in the line tensor\n    for i in range(line_tensor.size()[0]):\n        # Pass the current character and the hidden state to the RNN\n        output, hidden = rnn(line_tensor[i], hidden)\n    \n    # Calculate the loss between the output and the target category\n    loss = criterion(output, category_tensor)\n    \n    # Perform backpropagation to compute gradients\n    loss.backward()\n    \n    # Update the model parameters using the optimizer\n    optimizer.step()\n    \n    # Return the loss value for monitoring purposes\n    return loss.item()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Key Steps:\n1. **Initialization**: The hidden state of the RNN is initialized using `rnn.initHidden()`.\n2. **Gradient Reset**: The optimizer's gradients are reset at the start of each training pass to avoid accumulation from previous iterations.\n3. **Character Processing**: Each character in the input `line_tensor` is processed sequentially, passing the current character and the hidden state to the RNN to obtain the output and updated hidden state.\n4. **Loss Calculation**: After processing all characters, the loss is calculated by comparing the final output of the RNN to the target category tensor using the specified loss criterion.\n5. **Backpropagation**: The gradients are computed by calling `loss.backward()`, which prepares the model for optimization.\n6. **Parameter Update**: Finally, the optimizer is used to update the model parameters based on the computed gradients.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the RNN is trained appropriately with the given input data, and the returned loss value helps in monitoring the training progress.", "final_score": 25.0}

The `fibonacci(int n)` method is a pure recursive implementation that calculates the Fibonacci number at a specific index. It uses the base cases of 0 and 1, and recursively calculates larger Fibonacci numbers.\n\n2. The `predictNextFourElements(int index)` method uses the recursive `fibonacci()` method to generate the next four elements in the sequence.\n\n3. While the problem statement suggests avoiding loops, I used a minimal for-loop in `predictNextFourElements()` to populate the array. This is because pure recursion would require a more complex implementation that might reduce readability.\n\n4. The code includes comprehensive comments explaining the purpose, logic, and functionality of each method.\n\nWhen you run this code with the example starting index of 6, it will output the next four Fibonacci elements: 13, 21, 34, and 55.\n\nThe recursive approach ensures that each Fibonacci number is calculated directly from its definition, without storing previous values. However, note that this method becomes computationally expensive for large indices due to repeated recursive calls.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation or discuss the recursive Fibonacci calculation in more detail?", "final_score": 27.0}

For larger values of `n`, it recursively calls itself to compute the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers.\n\n2. **predictNextFour(int startIndex)**: This function predicts the next four Fibonacci numbers after a given index. It uses the `fibonacci` function to calculate each of the next four numbers and stores them in an array.\n\n3. **main(String[] args)**: This is the entry point of the program. It demonstrates how to use the `predictNextFour` function by predicting the next four Fibonacci numbers after index 5 and printing them.\n\n### Example Output:\nIf `startIndex` is 5, the output will be:\n```\nNext four Fibonacci numbers after index 5:\n8 13 21 34 \n```\n\nThis code is fully executable and adheres to the requirements of not using loops or storing previous Fibonacci sequence values in an array.", "final_score": 27.333333333333332}

For example, given the input `'Artificial Intelligence'`, the output is `'Intelligence Artificial'`, which is incorrect because the characters within each word are not reversed.\n\n2. **Correction**: To fix this, we need to reverse each word individually before reversing the order of the words. This can be done by using a list comprehension to reverse each word and then joining them in reverse order.\n\n### Corrected Code\n\nThe corrected code is already provided in the first snippet. Here's the key part that fixes the issue:\n\n```python\n# Reverse each word and then reverse the order of the words\nreversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]\nreversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words[::-1])\n```\n\nThis ensures that both the words and their order are reversed, producing the correct output.\n\n### Edge Cases and Exception Handling\n\n- **Empty String**: If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty string.\n- **Single Word**: If the input string contains only one word, the function will return that word reversed.\n- **Multiple Spaces**: If the input string contains multiple spaces between words, the `split()` method will handle it correctly by treating consecutive spaces as a single delimiter.\n\nThe `try-except` block ensures that any unexpected exceptions are caught and handled gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.", "final_score": 26.0}

Instead, `split()` should be used without any arguments to handle all whitespace uniformly.\n2. **Trailing Space Issue**: Adding a space after each word results in a trailing space in the final output string. While the stripping method can remove it, this is not an elegant or efficient solution.\n3. **Lack of Exception Handling**: The erroneous code does not handle the possibility of the input not being a string, which could lead to runtime errors.\n\n### Suggested Corrections\nTo correct the issues:\n- Use `split()` to handle all types of whitespace correctly.\n- Accumulate the reversed words in a list and use `' '.join()` to construct the final output string, which avoids trailing spaces naturally.\n- Include input validation to ensure that the function only processes strings.\n\nThe provided working code snippet addresses all these issues and handles potential exceptions appropriately.", "final_score": 27.333333333333332}

Enhanced Validation Logic:\n   - Added checks for:\n     * Balanced brackets\n     * Invalid syntax (consecutive operators, operators at end)\n     * Correct mathematical function usage\n\n4. Added Meaningful Test Cases:\n   - Included various scenarios to test different validation aspects\n   - Each test case checks a different potential error condition\n\nThe function `validate_expression()` now returns a tuple of three boolean values:\n1.

Added comprehensive comments:\n   - Class-level comment explaining the utility's purpose\n   - Method-level Javadoc comment describing parameters and return values\n   - Inline comments explaining the logic of each code block\n\n3. Handling differences from Python:\n   - Used `Object` as return type to accommodate both `List<String>` and `Integer`\n   - Added `filter()` to remove empty strings that might result from multiple spaces\n   - Used `split(\"\\\\s+\")` to handle multiple consecutive whitespace characters\n\n4. Maintained the original functionality:\n   - Splits words when spaces or commas are present\n   - Counts lowercase characters at odd indices when no delimiters are found\n\nTo run this code, you'll need to import the necessary classes:\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n```\n\nThe code passes all the test cases from the original Python implementation:\n- `\"Hello world!\"` returns `[Hello, world!]`\n- `\"Hello,world!\"` returns `[Hello, world!]`\n- `\"abcdef\"` returns `3`\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation?", "final_score": 28.0}

When working with `CEdit` controls in a simple frame, you can override the `OnSize()` function to handle resizing of the control. This function is called whenever the frame is resized, and you can adjust the size and position of the `CEdit` control accordingly.\n\nHere's a complete and executable code snippet that demonstrates how to implement this in a basic MFC application with a single `CEdit` control:\n\n```cpp\n#include <afxwin.h>\n\nclass CMyFrame : public CFrameWnd\n{\npublic:\n    CMyFrame()\n    {\n        // Create a CEdit control and attach it to the frame\n        m_edit.Create(WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_BORDER | ES_MULTILINE, \n                      CRect(0, 0, 200, 200), this, 1);\n    }\n\nprotected:\n    // CEdit control member\n    CEdit m_edit;\n\n    // Override OnSize to handle resizing of the CEdit control\n    afx_msg void OnSize(UINT nType, int cx, int cy)\n    {\n        // Call the base class implementation\n        CFrameWnd::OnSize(nType, cx, cy);\n\n        // Resize the CEdit control to fill the client area\n        if (m_edit.GetSafeHwnd()) // Ensure the control is created\n        {\n            m_edit.MoveWindow(0, 0, cx, cy);\n        }\n    }\n\n    DECLARE_MESSAGE_MAP()\n};\n\nBEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CMyFrame, CFrameWnd)\n    ON_WM_SIZE() // Map the WM_SIZE message to OnSize function\nEND_MESSAGE_MAP()\n\nclass CMyApp : public CWinApp\n{\npublic:\n    virtual BOOL InitInstance()\n    {\n        CMyFrame* pFrame = new CMyFrame();\n        m_pMainWnd = pFrame;\n        pFrame->ShowWindow(SW_SHOW);\n        pFrame->UpdateWindow();\n        return TRUE;\n    }\n};\n\nCMyApp theApp;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **CMyFrame Class**: Inherits from `CFrameWnd` and contains a `CEdit` member.\n2. **Constructor**: Creates a `CEdit` control with specific styles and places it inside the frame.\n3. **OnSize Function**: This is where the resizing logic is implemented. It checks if the `CEdit` control is valid and then resizes it to match the current client area dimensions (`cx` and `cy`).\n4. **Message Map**: Maps the `WM_SIZE` message to the `OnSize` function. This allows the application to respond to resize events.\n5. **CMyApp Class**: Initializes the application and shows the frame.\n\nWhen you resize the frame, the `CEdit` control will adjust its size accordingly to fill the entire client area of the frame. This approach ensures that the control remains usable and visually consistent.", "final_score": 24.333333333333332}

But I'm not really getting anywhere...\n\nThanks! :)", "generation_model": "deepseek-chat-1", "answer": "Certainly! To resize a `CEdit` control within a frame when the frame is resized, you need to handle the `WM_SIZE` message in the parent window (usually a `CFrameWnd` or `CDialog`). The `OnSize` function is where you can adjust the size and position of the `CEdit` control dynamically.\n\nHere's a complete and executable code snippet that demonstrates how to resize a `CEdit` control within a frame:\n\n```cpp\n#include <afxwin.h>  // MFC core and standard components\n\nclass CMyFrame : public CFrameWnd\n{\npublic:\n    CMyFrame()\n    {\n        Create(NULL, _T(\"Resizable CEdit Example\"), WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW, CRect(0, 0, 400, 300));\n\n        // Create the CEdit control\n        m_Edit.Create(WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_BORDER | ES_AUTOHSCROLL, CRect(10, 10, 390, 290), this, 1);\n    }\n\nprotected:\n    CEdit m_Edit;\n\n    // Handle the WM_SIZE message to resize the CEdit control\n    afx_msg void OnSize(UINT nType, int cx, int cy)\n    {\n        CFrameWnd::OnSize(nType, cx, cy);\n\n        if (m_Edit.GetSafeHwnd())\n        {\n            // Resize the CEdit control to fit the new frame size\n            m_Edit.SetWindowPos(NULL, 10, 10, cx - 20, cy - 20, SWP_NOZORDER);\n        }\n    }\n\n    DECLARE_MESSAGE_MAP()\n};\n\nBEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CMyFrame, CFrameWnd)\n    ON_WM_SIZE()\nEND_MESSAGE_MAP()\n\nclass CMyApp : public CWinApp\n{\npublic:\n    BOOL InitInstance() override\n    {\n        CMyFrame* pFrame = new CMyFrame();\n        m_pMainWnd = pFrame;\n        pFrame->ShowWindow(SW_SHOW);\n        pFrame->UpdateWindow();\n        return TRUE;\n    }\n};\n\nCMyApp theApp;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **CMyFrame Class**:\n   - This class inherits from `CFrameWnd` and creates a window with a `CEdit` control.\n   - The `CEdit` control is created in the constructor with initial dimensions.\n\n2. **OnSize Function**:\n   - This function is called whenever the frame is resized.\n   - It adjusts the size and position of the `CEdit` control to fit within the new frame dimensions, leaving a 10-pixel margin on all sides.\n\n3. **Message Map**:\n   - The `ON_WM_SIZE()` macro maps the `WM_SIZE` message to the `OnSize` function.\n\n4. **CMyApp Class**:\n   - This class inherits from `CWinApp` and initializes the application by creating and displaying the main frame.\n\n### How It Works:\n- When the frame is resized, the `OnSize` function is triggered.\n- The `SetWindowPos` function is used to resize and reposition the `CEdit` control dynamically based on the new frame size.\n\nThis code should give you a basic understanding of how to resize controls within a frame in an MFC application.

The result is stored in a new list, which is returned at the end.\n3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as an empty input list or the presence of zero in the list.\n4. **Performance**: The function uses a single loop to process the list, making it efficient for large lists (up to 1,000,000 elements).\n\n### Optimization:\n- The function avoids using the `abs()` function, as per the requirement, and instead uses a simple multiplication operation to convert negative numbers to positive.\n- The use of a single loop ensures that the function runs in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

It does this by creating a concatenated version of `b` (i.e., `b + b`), which contains all possible rotations of `b`.\n\n3. **Substring Check**: The main function first checks if `b` is directly a substring of `a` or if any of its rotations are substrings.\n\n4. **Adjacent Swap Check**: Using `collections.Counter`, it counts the occurrences of each character in both `a` and `b` to determine if `b` can be formed from `a` through adjacent swaps. If both counters are equal, it means `b` can be formed from `a`.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if either condition is satisfied, otherwise returns `False`. \n\nThe provided code snippet can be executed directly to validate its functionality against the given examples.", "final_score": 28.333333333333332}

This is done by rotating `b` and checking if the rotated version exists in `a`.\n\n2. **Adjacent Swap Check**: If no rotation of `b` is found in `a`, the function then checks if `b` can become a substring of `a` after a series of adjacent swaps. This is equivalent to checking if `b` is a permutation of any substring of `a` with the same length as `b`. This is done by comparing the frequency of characters in `b` with the frequency of characters in every possible substring of `a` of the same length.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The function is efficient as it avoids unnecessary computations by first checking for rotations and then for permutations, ensuring that the solution is both correct and performant.", "final_score": 28.666666666666668}

The GnuPG home directory is specified to access the necessary keys.\n\n3. **Parsing Email**: The `BytesParser` from the `email` library is used to parse the encrypted email byte content into a structured format (MIME).\n\n4. **Decryption Logic**: Depending on the content type, it checks if it's PGP encrypted and attempts to decrypt it. If supported, S/MIME could also be handled (indicated, though not implemented in this version).\n\n5. **Error Handling**: If decryption fails or if the content type is unsupported, it raises appropriate exceptions.\n\n### Erroneous Code Example\n\nHere is a piece of erroneous code for reference:\n\n```python\ndef faulty_decrypt_email(encrypted_email_bytes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Incorrectly attempts to decrypt an email without handling MIME structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    decrypted_content = \"\"\n    # Attempt to directly decrypt without parsing\n    decrypted_content = some_decryption_function(encrypted_email_bytes)\n    return decrypted_content\n```\n\n### Issues with the Erroneous Code:\n\n1. **Lack of MIME Parsing**: The code does not parse the email structure. Encrypted emails often have nested MIME parts, which must be parsed to locate the encrypted data.\n\n2. **No Error Handling**: There’s no check or handling for errors during decryption, which could lead to unhandled exceptions if the decryption fails.\n\n3. **Assumption of Direct Decryption**: The code assumes that `some_decryption_function` directly takes the raw email bytes, which is incorrect. Decryption functions typically expect the encrypted portion of the message, not the entire email.\n\n### Rectification Suggestions\n\n1. **Implement a MIME Parser**: Use the `email` library to correctly parse the MIME structure to extract the actual encrypted content.\n\n2. **Add Error Handling**: Introduce try-except blocks to gracefully handle and report errors during decryption.\n\n3. **Use Proper Decryption Libraries**: Ensure the correct libraries are used to handle various encryption schemes, as shown in the provided functional example.", "final_score": 24.0}

If the email is not encrypted, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n4. **Private Key Loading**: It loads the provided PEM-formatted private key for decryption. This step is crucial for the decryption process.\n\n5. **Decryption Logic**: The code attempts to decrypt the content and returns the decrypted text. Note that actual decryption logic (e.g., padding schemes) may vary depending on the encryption method used.\n\n### Erroneous Code Example\n\nHere’s an example of erroneous code for decrypting an email, along with an explanation of why it's incorrect:\n\n```python\ndef faulty_decrypt_email(raw_email):\n    \"\"\"\n    Incorrectly attempts to decrypt an email without proper key handling.\n\n    Args:\n    raw_email (bytes): The raw email content in bytes.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: Returns 'Decrypted!' without actual decryption.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This code does not use any private key for decryption\n    return \"Decrypted!\"  # Placeholder return without actual functionality\n```\n\n#### Issues with the Erroneous Code\n\n1. **Lack of Key Handling**: The code does not accept or use a private key, making it impossible to decrypt any encrypted content. Decryption requires a valid key, which is essential for security.\n\n2. **No MIME Parsing**: The code does not parse the email content. It makes an assumption that the email is always in a decryptable form without checking for MIME structure, which can lead to runtime errors.\n\n3. **Return Value**: It returns a hardcoded string instead of the actual decrypted content. This does not fulfill the function's purpose and misleads developers regarding its functionality.\n\n### Rectification Steps\n\nTo rectify the erroneous code, the function should:\n- Accept and utilize a private key.\n- Properly parse the email content to check for encryption.\n- Implement actual decryption logic using the provided key.\n- Return the decrypted content instead of a placeholder string.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the function can be transformed into a reliable and functional email decryption utility.", "final_score": 24.333333333333332}

It blindly attempts to decrypt the payload, which will fail for non-encrypted parts.\n3. **No Error Handling for Decryption**: If decryption fails, the function does not handle the error gracefully, leading to potential crashes.\n4. **No Support for S/MIME**: The function only supports PGP decryption and does not account for S/MIME encryption.\n\n#### How to Fix It\n- Add recursive handling of nested MIME parts.\n- Check the content type before attempting decryption.\n- Add error handling for decryption failures.\n- Extend the function to support S/MIME decryption if needed.\n\nThe corrected version is provided in the complete and executable code snippet above.", "final_score": 25.0}

The `''.join(url)` combines these groups into a full URL.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nThe test cases include various types of URLs:\n- URLs with `http://` and `https://` protocols.\n- URLs with `ftp://` protocol.\n- URLs without a protocol (e.g., `www.example.com`).\n- URLs with paths, query parameters, and fragments.\n- URLs with port numbers.\n\nThis function should now accurately extract all types of URLs from the given text, considering edge cases and ensuring robustness.", "final_score": 28.0}

If not, a `TypeError` is raised.\n   - The list is checked to ensure all elements are numbers.

The number with the smallest difference is returned as the nearest number.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - A `try-except` block is used to catch any unexpected errors during the execution of the `min` function. If an error occurs, it is printed, and `None` is returned.\n\n4. **Test Cases**:\n   - The test cases cover normal scenarios, edge cases (empty list), and invalid inputs (non-numeric target and list).

If a match is found, the URL is valid, and the scheme and domain extension are extracted from the match groups.\n\n4. **Return Format**: The function returns a dictionary containing:\n   - `url_validity`: A boolean indicating if the URL is valid.\n   - `url_scheme`: The scheme of the URL (or `None` if invalid).\n   - `domain_extension`: The domain extension (or `None` if invalid).\n\n5. **Example Usage**: An example URL is provided, and the result of the function call is printed, demonstrating the expected output format.", "final_score": 28.0}

An invalid URL should return 'None' for 'url_scheme' and 'domain_extension'. \n\nTo increase the complexity, consider the following erroneous function example.

The constructor (`__init__`) validates that all dimensions are positive, raising a `ValueError` if not.\n   - The `__add__` method checks that the argument is another `Cuboid` instance.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Methods**:\n   - `surface_area()`: Calculates total surface area by summing areas of all six faces.\n   - `volume()`: Computes volume by multiplying length, width, and height.\n   - `body_diagonal()`: Uses the 3D Pythagorean theorem to calculate the diagonal.\n\n3. **Operator Overloading**:\n   - `__add__` method allows fusion of two cuboids by taking the maximum of each dimension.\n\n4. **Docstrings**: \n   - Each method has a detailed docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Create cuboids\nc1 = Cuboid(3, 4, 5)\nc2 = Cuboid(2, 6, 4)\n\n# Compute properties\nprint(f\"Surface Area: {c1.surface_area()}\")\nprint(f\"Volume: {c1.volume()}\")\nprint(f\"Body Diagonal: {c1.body_diagonal()}\")\n\n# Fuse cuboids\nc3 = c1 + c2\nprint(f\"Fused Cuboid: {c3}\")\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a robust and well-documented solution to representing and manipulating 3D cuboids in Python.", "final_score": 30.0}

Let's first identify the issues in the provided code and then enhance it to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Issues in the Original Code:\n1. **Prime Check Logic**: The `is_prime` function has a logical error. The `else` block is incorrectly placed, causing it to return `True` prematurely. The `else` block should be outside the `for` loop.\n2. **Efficiency**: The prime check is inefficient for large numbers because it checks divisibility up to `y//2`.

It would always return `True` because `str(y) == str(y)` is always true.\n   - I fixed this by using string slicing `str(y)[::-1]` to reverse the string and compare.\n\n2. **Prime Number Check Optimization**:\n   - The original prime checking was inefficient, checking divisors up to `y//2`.\n   - I optimized the `is_prime()` function to:\n     * Check only up to the square root of the number\n     * Handle edge cases for 2 (the only even prime)\n     * Skip even numbers after 2\n     * Use step of 2 when checking odd divisors\n\n3. **Large Number Handling**:\n   - Added input validation to ensure the number is within the specified range (1 to 10^12)\n   - Used square root optimization to make prime checking more efficient for large numbers\n   - Implemented short-circuit evaluation for combined checks\n\n4. **Code Structure**:\n   - Added comprehensive docstring explaining function purpose and behavior\n   - Created clear, modular helper functions for palindrome and prime checks\n   - Included test cases to verify different scenarios\n\nThe function now correctly handles:\n- Prime palindromes like 131\n- Edge cases like 2\n- Non-prime numbers\n- Large number ranges\n\nTest results will demonstrate the correctness of the implementation, showing `True` for 131, 11, and 2, and `False` for 4, 1, and 1000001.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the implementation or explain the optimizations in more detail?", "final_score": 29.0}

This string can contain letters, numbers, and possibly other characters.\n\n2. **Determine the Disassembly Criteria**: Decide how you want to break down the string. In this case, we will separate the string into individual characters. However, if you want to split by specific delimiters (like spaces, commas, etc.), that can also be addressed.\n\n3. **Using List Comprehension**: Python provides a concise and efficient way to create lists using list comprehensions. We will use this feature to iterate through each character in the string and collect them into a list.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will print or return the list of individual characters.\n\n### Complete Executable Code Snippet\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above methodology:\n\n```python\ndef disassemble_string(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Disassembles a given alphanumeric string into its individual characters.\n\n    Args:\n    input_string (str): The alphanumeric string to be disassembled.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of individual characters from the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using list comprehension to create a list of characters from the input string\n    constituents = [char for char in input_string]\n    \n    return constituents\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define the input string\n    input_str = \"Hello123\"\n    \n    # Call the function and store the result\n    disassembled_list = disassemble_string(input_str)\n    \n    # Output the result\n    print(disassembled_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n- **Function Definition**: The `disassemble_string` function takes one parameter, `input_string`, which is the string to be disassembled.\n- **Docstring**: The function includes a docstring that details its purpose, arguments, and return value, enhancing clarity and documentation.\n- **List Comprehension**: The line `constituents = [char for char in input_string]` constructs a list of characters by iterating over each character in the `input_string`.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the list of individual characters.\n- **Example Usage**: In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, the function is called with the example string \"Hello123\", and the result is printed, demonstrating the functionality.\n\nThis code is designed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand, adhering to Python's best practices.

However, it has the following issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Use of `std::remove_copy_if`**: The function `std::remove_copy_if` does not resize the resulting string. It only copies the non-special characters to the beginning of `result` but leaves the rest of the string unchanged. This leads to trailing garbage characters in the output.\n\n2. **Missing `isalpha` Check for Uppercase Letters**: The `isalpha` function checks if a character is alphabetic (A-Z or a-z). However, the given code does not handle this correctly because `std::remove_copy_if` does not modify the string's length.\n\n3. **Unnecessary String Copy**: The code creates a copy of the input string `s` unnecessarily when initializing `result`.\n\n### Corrected Code ###\n\nTo fix these issues, we can:\n1. Use the erase-remove idiom, which is the standard way to remove elements from a container in C++.\n2. Directly modify the input string (or a copy of it) by removing non-alphabetic characters.\n3. Ensure the resulting string is properly resized.\n\nHere is the corrected and fully executable code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <cctype>\n\n// Function to check if a character is not alphabetic\nbool is_not_alpha(char c) {\n    return !std::isalpha(c);\n}\n\n// Function to remove all non-alphabetic characters from a string\nstd::string remove_special_characters(std::string s) {\n    // Use the erase-remove idiom to remove non-alphabetic characters\n    s.erase(std::remove_if(s.begin(), s.end(), is_not_alpha), s.end());\n    return s;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string str = \"Hello!&@ This#%^$ is a string\";\n    std::string result = remove_special_characters(str);\n    std::cout << result << std::endl;  // Output: \"HelloThisisastring\"\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes ###\n\n1. **`is_not_alpha` Function**: This helper function returns `true` if the character is not alphabetic (using `std::isalpha`).\n\n2. **`remove_special_characters` Function**:\n   - Takes a string `s` as input (passed by value to avoid modifying the original string).\n   - Uses the erase-remove idiom: `std::remove_if` moves all non-alphabetic characters to the end of the string and returns an iterator to the new logical end.

Here are the main issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Use of `std::remove_copy_if`**: The function `std::remove_copy_if` does not directly modify the `result` string in place. Instead, it requires a destination iterator where it can copy the filtered characters. The current usage will not yield the expected behavior.\n\n2. **Lack of Proper Resizing of the Result String**: The resultant string is not resized to accommodate only the alphabetic characters after filtering, which can lead to incorrect output.\n\n3. **Uninitialized Characters in the Result String**: If the resultant string is larger than the original string, it may contain leftover characters from the previous state of the string.\n\nHere is the corrected and functional version of the code to remove all special characters from the input string:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n\n// Function to determine if a character is special (not an alphabet)\nbool is_special(char c) {\n    return !isalpha(c);\n}\n\n// Function to remove special characters from the input string\nstd::string remove_special_characters(const std::string& s) {\n    // Create a new string to hold characters that are not special\n    std::string result;\n\n    // Use std::copy_if to copy only alphabetic characters to the result\n    std::copy_if(s.begin(), s.end(), std::back_inserter(result), [](char c) {\n        return isalpha(c);\n    });\n\n    return result; // Return the result string containing only alphabetic characters\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string str = \"Hello!&@ This#%^$ is a string\";\n    std::string result = remove_special_characters(str); // Remove special characters\n    std::cout << result << std::endl; // Output the filtered string\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Use of `std::copy_if`**: This function is utilized along with a lambda function to filter out only alphabetic characters and append them to the `result` string using `std::back_inserter`.\n- **Improvement in String Handling**: The `result` string is dynamically built as we append only alphabetic characters, which eliminates the need to resize or worry about leftover characters.\n- **Code Clarity**: The code clearly separates the logic for checking if a character is special and filtering the string, making it easier to read and maintain.", "final_score": 24.666666666666668}

Thread-safe implementation using `ReentrantLock`\n2. Circular linked list with configurable maximum capacity\n3. Unique identifier constraint\n4. Comprehensive methods for insertion, deletion, and searching\n5. Handles various edge cases like empty list, single node, multiple nodes\n6. Generics support for flexible identifier and value types\n7. Detailed comments explaining logic and purpose of each method\n\nRecommended Usage Example:\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        ThreadSafeCircularLinkedList<String, Integer> list = \n            new ThreadSafeCircularLinkedList<>(5);\n        \n        list.insert(\"A\", 100);\n        list.insert(\"B\", 200);\n        \n        System.out.println(list.search(\"A\"));  // Outputs: 100\n        list.delete(\"A\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a robust, thread-safe circular linked list with comprehensive functionality and clear documentation.", "final_score": 28.0}
