We then enter a `while` loop that prompts the user to enter the hashing algorithm they want to use. The loop continues until a valid algorithm is entered.\n5. Once a valid algorithm is selected, we update the corresponding `hashlib` object with the input string (encoded as bytes) using the `update` method.\n6.

The `tokenize` method splits the text into individual tokens.\n2. **Joining Tokens**: The tokenized text is then joined back into a single string with spaces between tokens. This is necessary because the `text_normalizer.normalize` function expects a single string as input.\n3. **Normalization**: The `text_normalizer.normalize` function is called with the specified parameters to normalize the text. The `accent` parameter is set based on whether the language requires accent removal, and other parameters are set to `False` or `True` as per the requirements.\n4. **Return**: The normalized text is returned as the final output of the `do` method.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the text is properly tokenized and normalized according to the specified rules, and the normalized text is returned for further use.", "final_score": 28.333333333333332}

The getCount() method should return the count of indices in the buffer.\n\nComplete the class definition for OpenGLIndexBuffer and ensure that it can be used to manage index buffers in an OpenGL-based graphics application.", "generation_model": "deepseek-chat-1", "answer": "```cpp\n#include <cstdint>\n#include <GL/glew.h> // Include GLEW for OpenGL function loading\n\nclass OpenGLIndexBuffer {\npublic:\n    // Constructor\n    OpenGLIndexBuffer(const uint32_t* data, uint32_t count)\n        : mCount(count) {\n        // Generate a buffer object\n        glGenBuffers(1, &mRendererID);\n        // Bind the buffer object to the GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER target\n        glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, mRendererID);\n        // Upload the index data to the buffer\n        glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, count * sizeof(uint32_t), data, GL_STATIC_DRAW);\n    }\n\n    // Destructor\n    ~OpenGLIndexBuffer() {\n        // Delete the buffer object\n        glDeleteBuffers(1, &mRendererID);\n    }\n\n    // Method to bind the index buffer\n    void bind() const {\n        glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, mRendererID);\n    }\n\n    // Method to get the count of indices in the buffer\n    uint32_t getCount() const {\n        return mCount;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    // Member variables needed for managing the index buffer\n    uint32_t mRendererID; // OpenGL buffer ID\n    uint32_t mCount;      // Number of indices in the buffer\n};\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Constructor**:\n   - The constructor takes two parameters: a pointer to the index data (`data`) and the count of indices (`count`).\n   - It generates a buffer object using `glGenBuffers` and stores the generated ID in `mRendererID`.\n   - The buffer is then bound to the `GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER` target using `glBindBuffer`.\n   - The index data is uploaded to the buffer using `glBufferData`.\n\n2. **Destructor**:\n   - The destructor deletes the buffer object using `glDeleteBuffers` to free up resources.\n\n3. **bind() Method**:\n   - This method binds the index buffer by calling `glBindBuffer` with the `GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER` target and the stored `mRendererID`.\n\n4. **getCount() Method**:\n   - This method simply returns the count of indices stored in `mCount`.\n\n### Usage Example:\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    // Initialize GLEW (assuming OpenGL context is already created)\n    glewInit();\n\n    // Example index data\n    uint32_t indices[] = { 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0 };\n\n    // Create an index buffer\n    OpenGLIndexBuffer indexBuffer(indices, 6);\n\n    // Bind the index buffer\n    indexBuffer.bind();\n\n    // Get the count of indices\n    uint32_t count = indexBuffer.getCount();\n    // count will be 6\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a complete and functional `OpenGLIndexBuffer` class that can be used to manage index buffers in an OpenGL-based graphics application.", "final_score": 30.0}

If no `options` are provided, it should default to `None`.\n- The class should have the following attributes:\n  - `_items`: This should store the key-value pairs of the input dictionary.\n  - `_object_id`: This should store the unique identifier of the object, obtained using the `get_object_id` method from the base class.\n  - `_max_len`: This should store the maximum size of the object, which is determined based on the provided `options` or the length of the input dictionary if no `options` are provided.\n  - `_render_options`: This should store the rendering options for the object, and it should default to `None`.\n\nYour task is to complete the implementation of the `KvpHeapObjectFactory` class based on the provided code snippet and the outlined features.", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-1", "answer": "Here's the implementation of the `KvpHeapObjectFactory` class that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\nclass HeapObjectFactory:\n    def __init__(self, obj, options=None):\n        self._object_id = self.get_object_id(obj)\n        self._max_len = self.get_max_length(obj, options)\n        self._render_options = self.get_render_options(options)\n\n    def get_object_id(self, obj):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a unique identifier for the object.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def get_max_length(self, obj, options):\n        \"\"\"\n        Determines the maximum size of the object.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def get_render_options(self, options):\n        \"\"\"\n        Extracts the rendering options from the provided options.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\nclass KvpHeapObjectFactory(HeapObjectFactory):\n    def __init__(self, obj, options=None):\n        self._items = obj\n        super().__init__(obj, options)\n\n    def get_object_id(self, obj):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a unique identifier for the key-value pair object.\n        \"\"\"\n        return hash(frozenset(obj.items()))\n\n    def get_max_length(self, obj, options):\n        \"\"\"\n        Determines the maximum size of the key-value pair object.\n        \"\"\"\n        if options and options.max_size:\n            return options.max_size\n        else:\n            return len(obj)\n\n    def get_render_options(self, options):\n        \"\"\"\n        Extracts the rendering options from the provided options.\n        \"\"\"\n        if options:\n            return options.render_options\n        else:\n            return None\n```\n\nHere's how the `KvpHeapObjectFactory` class works:\n\n1. The constructor takes two parameters: `obj` (a dictionary representing the key-value pair object) and `options` (an optional `Options` object).\n2. The constructor initializes the `_items` attribute with the input dictionary `obj`.\n3. The constructor calls the `super().__init__(obj, options)` method to initialize the base class attributes (`_object_id`, `_max_len`, and `_render_options`).\n4. The `get_object_id` method generates a unique identifier for the key-value pair object by hashing the frozen set of its items.\n5. The `get_max_length` method determines the maximum size of the key-value pair object. If `options` are provided and `options.max_size` is set, it uses that value. Otherwise, it uses the length of the input dictionary.\n6. The `get_render_options` method extracts the rendering options from the provided `options`. If `options` are provided and `options.render_options` is set, it uses that value. Otherwise, it sets `_render_options` to `None`.\n\nThis implementation of the `KvpHeapObjectFactory` class follows the requirements outlined in the problem statement and extends the functionality of the base `HeapObjectFactory` class.", "final_score": 30.0}

The `ConfigVariable` class represents a single configuration variable with its name, type, and description.\n2. The `ConfigManager` class is responsible for managing the configuration variables. It uses an `unordered_map` to store the registered configuration variables.\n3. The `registerConfigVariable` method is used to add a new configuration variable to the `ConfigManager`.\n4. The `getDescription` method takes the name of a configuration variable as a parameter and returns its description. If the variable is not found, it returns \"Variable not found\".\n5. In the `main` function, we create two `ConfigVariable` objects and register them with the `ConfigManager`. Then, we use the `getDescription` method to retrieve the descriptions of the variables, including a non-existent variable.\n\nWhen you run this code, the output will be:\n\n```\nThis is a list of glob patterns for texture filenames (excluding the directory part of the filename, but including the extension); for instance, 'digits_*.png'.

The `Callback` class has two main methods: `registerCallback` and `invokeCallbacks`.\n\n2. The `registerCallback` method takes a `std::function<void()>` as a parameter and adds it to the `callbacks` vector. To ensure thread safety, we use a `std::mutex` (`callbacksMutex`) to guard the access to the `callbacks` vector.\n\n3. The `invokeCallbacks` method is responsible for invoking all the registered callbacks. To ensure thread safety, we follow these steps:\n   - We create a local copy of the `callbacks` vector by locking the `callbacksMutex` and copying the contents. This is done to minimize the critical section and avoid potential deadlocks.\n   - After creating the local copy, we release the lock on the `callbacksMutex`.\n   - Finally, we iterate through the local copy of the `callbacks` vector and invoke each callback.\n\n   This approach ensures that the `invokeCallbacks` method can be safely called from multiple threads without causing data races or other synchronization issues.\n\n4. In the `main` function, we create a `Callback` instance and register two callbacks. Then, we use OpenMP to simulate parallel processing and invoke the `invokeCallbacks` method within the parallel loop.\n\nThis implementation of the `Callback` class provides a thread-safe mechanism for registering and invoking callbacks, ensuring that the callbacks can be safely called from multiple threads without causing any synchronization issues.", "final_score": 30.0}

The `wrapper` function calls the `multiple_change_quota` function and stores the result.\n7.

The class has a private member variable `isPM` to keep track of whether the time is in the PM period.\n3. The constructor `CivilianTimeImp(int hr, int min)` calls the constructor of the base class `TimeImp(int hr, int min)` to set the time in the 24-hour format, and then calls the `setTime()` function to set the time in the civilian format.\n4. The `setTime(int hr, int min, int pm)` function sets the time in the civilian format. It first calls the `setTime()` function of the base class `TimeImp` to set the time in the 24-hour format, and then sets the `isPM` flag based on the provided `pm` parameter.\n5. The `displayTime()` function displays the time in the civilian format. It first retrieves the hour from the base class using the `getHour()` function. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 to get the hour in the 12-hour format. If the hour is 0, it sets the hour to 12 to represent 12:00 AM. It then uses the `getMinute()` function from the base class to get the minute and the `isPM` flag to determine whether the time is in the AM or PM period. The time is then displayed in the format \"hh:mm AM/PM\".\n\nThis implementation ensures that the `CivilianTimeImp` class correctly represents and manipulates time in the civilian format, while utilizing the functionality provided by the base class `TimeImp`.", "final_score": 29.333333333333332}

The `performActionOnDoubleTap` method is where you can implement the specific action you want to perform when a double tap is detected.

The `calculate_total_size` function takes the organized package data and a package name as input, and returns the total size of the package and its dependencies.\n   - It initializes the `total_size` variable to 0.\n   - It checks if the given package name exists in the `organized_packages` dictionary.\n   - If the package name exists, it iterates through all the packages in the `organized_packages` dictionary.\n   - For each package, it checks if the package name is the same as the given package name or if the package is a dependency of the given package.\n   - If the condition is true, it adds the size of the package to the `total_size` variable.\n   - Finally, it returns the `total_size`.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the `organize_packages` and `calculate_total_size` functions with the provided input data.", "final_score": 20.333333333333332}

For this example, you will need to ensure that you have access to Bloomberg's API and that the `pdblp` library is properly installed.\n\n```python\nimport pdblp\nimport pandas as pd\nimport datetime\n\n# Create a session to connect to Bloomberg\ncon = pdblp.BCon(debug=True, port=8194, timeout=5000)\ncon.start()\n\n# Define the ticker symbol and the fields you want\nticker = \"AAPL US Equity\"  # Example ticker symbol\nfields = [\"PX_LAST\", \"PX_OPEN\", \"PX_HIGH\", \"PX_LOW\", \"VOLUME\"]\n\n# Define the start and end time for data retrieval\nend_time = datetime.datetime.now()\nstart_time = end_time - datetime.timedelta(days=7)  # Retrieve last 7 days of minute data\n\n# Retrieve historical minute data\nminute_data = con.bdh(ticker, fields, start_time, end_time, \n                       Options={'periodicitySelection': 'P1M', 'returnType': 'array'})\n\n# Convert the data to a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(minute_data, columns=['Date', 'PX_LAST', 'PX_OPEN', 'PX_HIGH', 'PX_LOW', 'VOLUME'])\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n\n# Stop the connection\ncon.stop()\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure you replace `\"AAPL US Equity\"` with the desired ticker symbol.\n- Make sure Bloomberg Terminal is running and you have the necessary credentials and access rights.\n- The above code retrieves minute data for the last 7 days, but you can customize the date range as needed. \n- Depending on your Bloomberg subscription, you may have specific limitations on the data you can retrieve.", "final_score": 25.666666666666668}

This can lead to errors when trying to decrypt non-encrypted content.\n\n3. **No Exception Information**:\n   - If decryption fails, the code does not provide any meaningful error message or context, making it difficult to debug.\n\n#### How to Fix It\n- Add error handling to check if decryption was successful.\n- Add a content-type check to ensure only encrypted parts are decrypted.\n- Provide detailed error messages for debugging.\n\n#### Fixed Code (Same as the Complete Code Above)\nThe complete code snippet provided earlier addresses all these issues by:\n1.

The original pattern used `$` at the end, which restricts the match to the end of the string. This was removed to allow matching URLs anywhere in the text.\n2. The original pattern did not account for `ftp://` URLs, which were added in the corrected pattern.\n3. The `re.findall` function returns a list of tuples when capturing groups are used. The corrected code joins these tuples into full URLs.\n\n### Test Cases:\nThe function is tested with various types of URLs, including:\n- URLs with and without protocols (`http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`).\n- URLs with and without `www.`.\n- URLs with paths, query parameters, and fragments.\n- URLs with port numbers.\n\n### Output:\n```python\n['http://example.com', 'https://www.example.com/path', 'ftp://ftp.example.com', 'www.example.com', 'http://localhost:8080', 'https://example.com/path/to/resource?query=param#fragment']\n```\n\nThis solution is accurate, efficient, and handles edge cases effectively.", "final_score": 25.333333333333332}

The use of non-capturing groups for optional components (like the port and path) ensures that the function can handle a range of URL formats while filtering out invalid ones.\n\n### Testing\nThe function is tested against multiple test cases, including valid and invalid URLs, to demonstrate its ability to accurately identify and extract URLs from a given text.", "final_score": 25.666666666666668}

It captures `http`, `https`, and `ftp`.\n- `[a-z0-9\\-]+`: Matches the domain name and allows for alphanumeric characters and hyphens.\n- `(\\.[a-z0-9\\-]+)+`: Matches the domain extensions, ensuring at least one dot followed by more valid characters.\n- `(:\\d+)?`: Optionally matches a port number if it exists, which starts with a colon followed by digits.\n- `(/[^\\s]*)?`: Optionally matches the path of the URL, allowing for any characters until a whitespace is encountered.\n- `\\b`: Another word boundary to close the URL match.\n\n### Why It Works:\nThis regular expression is designed to match valid URLs that start with specific protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP), include a domain and possibly a path, and accommodate common variations such as ports and subdomains.

A `static_assert` ensures that `T` is a numeric type.\n2. **Components**: The quaternion is represented by four components: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n3. **Multiplication**: The `operator*` method implements quaternion multiplication, ensuring correct handling of the components.\n4. **Conjugation**: The `conjugate` method returns the conjugate of the quaternion.\n5. **Precision and Type Safety**: The use of templates ensures type correctness, and arithmetic operations are handled with the precision of the underlying type `T`.\n6. **Example Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates quaternion multiplication and conjugation using `double` as the numeric type.\n\nThis code is modular, well-structured, and adheres to the provided requirements.", "final_score": 28.0}

It should filter out numbers that meet both criteria instead.\n\n### How to Correct It\n\nTo correct the code, the range check should be modified to exclude the boundaries, and the logical condition should be structured to properly reflect the requirements:\n\n- Change the range check to `start < num < end`.\n- Ensure the logic properly checks for both conditions of divisibility and being in range together. \n\nThis will ensure that the function behaves correctly and meets all specified requirements.", "final_score": 29.666666666666668}

Specifically:\n1. The `else` block in the inner loop is incorrectly placed. It appends the number to the `filtered_list` if the number is not within any range, even if it is divisible by 7.\n2. The `break` statement in the inner loop causes the loop to exit prematurely, preventing the function from checking all ranges for a given number.\n\n---\n\n### How to Correct the Erroneous Code:\nTo fix the code:\n1. Use a flag to track whether a number divisible by 7 falls within any range.\n2. Only append the number to the `filtered_list` if it is not divisible by 7 or does not fall within any range.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the erroneous code:\n```python\ndef filter_integers(original_list, ranges):\n    filtered_list = []\n    for num in original_list:\n        if num % 7 != 0:\n            filtered_list.append(num)\n        else:\n            # Check if the number falls within any range\n            in_range = False\n            for start, end in ranges:\n                if start <= num <= end:\n                    in_range = True\n                    break\n            if not in_range:\n                filtered_list.append(num)\n    return filtered_list\n\n# Example usage\noriginal_list = [28, 12, 49, 33, 15, 70, 27]\nranges = [(10, 50), (60, 80)]\nprint(filter_integers(original_list, ranges))  # Output: [12, 33, 15, 27]\n```\n\nThis corrected version ensures that numbers divisible by 7 and within any range are properly excluded from the result.", "final_score": 30.0}

However, this logic is flawed because it only checks the first range and ignores subsequent ranges.\n   - For example, if a number is divisible by 7 but does not fall within the first range, it will still be added to the filtered list, even if it falls within a later range.\n\n2. **Correction**:\n   - The correct implementation uses a set (`numbers_to_remove`) to track all numbers that should be removed. This ensures that all ranges are checked, and numbers divisible by 7 within any range are excluded.\n   - The filtering step then removes all numbers in the set from the original list, ensuring the correct result.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Output:\nFor the input:\n```python\noriginal_list = [28, 12, 49, 33, 15, 70, 27]\nranges = [(10, 50), (60, 80)]\n```\nThe output will be:\n```python\n[12, 33, 15, 27]\n```", "final_score": 30.0}

It returns an integer representing the count of the digit '5' in numbers that are divisible by 9, 14, or `m` within the specified ranges.\n\n2. **Sequence Generation**:\n   - **Ascending Sequence**: A loop runs from `start_range` to `n-1`, checking if each number is divisible by 9, 14, or `m`. If it is, the number is added to the `ascending_sequence` vector.\n   - **Descending Sequence**: A loop runs from `end_range` to `n+1` in reverse order, checking the same divisibility conditions. If a number meets the conditions, it is added to the `descending_sequence` vector.\n\n3. **Combining Sequences**: The `ascending_sequence` and `descending_sequence` vectors are combined into a single vector called `total_sequence`.\n\n4. **Counting '5's**: The function iterates through each number in `total_sequence`, converts it to a string, and counts the occurrences of the digit '5'.

The function `remove_all_null_rows()` uses Pandas' `dropna()` method with the `how='all'` parameter.\n   - `how='all'` specifically targets rows where ALL columns are null.\n   - This means rows with even a single non-null value will be retained.\n\n2.

I've addressed these issues and optimized the prime checking process.\n\nHere's the complete and executable code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef prime_palindrome(n):\n    def is_palindrome(y): \n        return str(y) == str(y)[::-1]\n        \n    def is_prime(y):\n        if y <= 1:\n            return False\n        if y <= 3:\n            return True\n        if y % 2 == 0 or y % 3 == 0:\n            return False\n        i = 5\n        while i * i <= y:\n            if y % i == 0 or y % (i + 2) == 0:\n                return False\n            i += 6\n        return True\n\n    return is_palindrome(n) and is_prime(n)\n\n# Testing the function\nprint(prime_palindrome(131))  # should return True\nprint(prime_palindrome(12321))  # should return True\nprint(prime_palindrome(10))  # should return False\nprint(prime_palindrome(2))  # should return True\nprint(prime_palindrome(11))  # should return True\n```\n\n### Code Explanation:\n1. **is_palindrome(y)**: This function checks if the number `y` is a palindrome by comparing the string representation of `y` with its reverse.\n\n2. **is_prime(y)**: This function checks if `y` is a prime number. It efficiently checks for divisibility only up to the square root of `y`, first eliminating even numbers and then checking odd numbers starting from 5 (and skipping even numbers).\n\n3. The main function, `prime_palindrome(n)`, combines both checks and returns `True` only if both conditions are satisfied.\n\n### Efficiency:\n- This version of `is_prime` is much more efficient for larger numbers due to reduced iterations in the prime checking logic, making it suitable for inputs up to `10^12`.", "final_score": 28.0}
{"index": 492, "programming_language": "python", "code-instruction": "Create a function that not only detects if a given numerical sequence constitutes a palindromic number, but also identifies if that number is a prime number. The function should be able to handle large numbers efficiently. As an additional challenge, debug the following erroneous code that attempts to achieve the same task. \n\n```python\ndef prime_palindrome(n):\n    def is_palindrome(y): \n        return str(y) == str(y)[::-1]\n        \n    def is_prime(y):\n        if y > 1:\n            for i in range(2, y//2):\n                if (y % i) == 0:\n                    return False\n            else:\n                return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\n    if is_palindrome(n) and is_prime(n):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False \n\nprint(prime_palindrome(131))  # supposed to return True, but returns False\n```\n\nFind out what's wrong with the code, debug it, and enhance it to handle large numbers more efficiently.

This can be optimized by checking divisibility only up to the square root of `y`.\n\n2. **Range in Prime Check**: The range in the `is_prime` function should be `range(2, int(y**0.5) + 1)` to optimize the prime check.\n\n3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function should handle edge cases such as `n = 1` correctly. The number `1` is not a prime number.\n\n4. **Return Value**: The function should return `True` or `False` directly based on the conditions, rather than using an `if-else` statement.\n\nHere is the corrected and optimized version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef prime_palindrome(n):\n    def is_palindrome(y):\n        return str(y) == str(y)[::-1]\n        \n    def is_prime(y):\n        if y < 2:\n            return False\n        if y in (2, 3):\n            return True\n        if y % 2 == 0 or y % 3 == 0:\n            return False\n        i = 5\n        while i * i <= y:\n            if y % i == 0 or y % (i + 2) == 0:\n                return False\n            i += 6\n        return True\n\n    return is_palindrome(n) and is_prime(n)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(prime_palindrome(131))  # Expected output: True\nprint(prime_palindrome(12321))  # Expected output: True\nprint(prime_palindrome(12345))  # Expected output: False\nprint(prime_palindrome(1))  # Expected output: False\nprint(prime_palindrome(2))  # Expected output: True\nprint(prime_palindrome(3))  # Expected output: True\nprint(prime_palindrome(4))  # Expected output: False\nprint(prime_palindrome(11))  # Expected output: True\nprint(prime_palindrome(13))  # Expected output: False\nprint(prime_palindrome(1000000007))  # Expected output: True (if it's a prime palindrome)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n1. **Prime Check Optimization**: The `is_prime` function now checks divisibility only up to the square root of `y`, which significantly reduces the number of iterations for large numbers.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as `n = 1`.\n3. **Return Value**: The function directly returns the result of the logical AND operation between `is_palindrome(n)` and `is_prime(n)`.\n\nThis optimized function should now handle large numbers efficiently and correctly identify prime palindromic numbers.", "final_score": 28.333333333333332}
