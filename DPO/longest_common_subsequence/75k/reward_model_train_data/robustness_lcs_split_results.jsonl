The method should return `true` if the given number is a perfect number, and `false` otherwise.

First, we check if the input `num` is less than or equal to 1, as perfect numbers are positive integers greater than 1. If so, we return `false`.\n2. We initialize the `sum` variable to 1, as 1 is always a proper divisor of any positive integer.\n3. We iterate through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `num`. For each number `i`, we check if it is a divisor of `num` (i.e., `num % i == 0`).\n4. If `i` is a divisor, we add it to the `sum`. Additionally, if `i` is not equal to `num / i` (meaning `num / i` is a different divisor), we also add `num / i` to the `sum`.\n5. Finally, we check if the `sum` is equal to the original `num`. If so, we return `true`, indicating that `num` is a perfect number. Otherwise, we return `false`.\n\nThe time complexity of this implementation is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input number `num`, as we only need to iterate up to the square root of `num`. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.", "final_score": 24.0}

The method first checks if the input `num` is a positive integer. If not, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a clear error message.\n2. The method then initializes a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of the proper divisors of `num`.\n3. It then iterates from 1 to `num/2` (since the proper divisors of a number cannot be greater than half the number) and checks if each number `i` is a divisor of `num`. If so, it adds `i` to the `sum` variable.\n4. Finally, the method checks if the `sum` is equal to the original `num`. If so, it returns `true`, indicating that `num` is a perfect number. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe code handles the following requirements:\n\n1. **Exception Handling**:\n   - The method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the input `num` is not a positive integer, providing a clear error message.\n   - The exception message is clear and informative, enabling developers to understand the issue and diagnose the problem.\n   - Throwing an exception is appropriate in this case, as a negative or zero input is not a valid input for the `checkPerfectNumber` method.\n\n2. **Boundary Conditions and Special Cases Handling**:\n   - The method handles the boundary condition of `num` being 0 or a negative integer by throwing an exception.\n   - The method correctly handles the case where `num` is a perfect number by returning `true` when the sum of the proper divisors is equal to `num`.\n   - The method validates the input by ensuring that `num` is a positive integer, preventing any potential issues with invalid inputs.\n\n3. **Fault Tolerance**:\n   - The method can recover from the exception by handling the `IllegalArgumentException` and returning the appropriate result (`false`) for invalid inputs.\n   - The system can continue to operate even if the `checkPerfectNumber` method encounters an invalid input, as the exception is handled gracefully.\n\n4. **Resource Management**:\n   - The method does not require any external resources, so there are no resource management concerns.\n   - The memory usage of the method is efficient, as it only uses a single variable (`sum`) to keep track of the sum of the proper divisors.\n\nOverall, the provided implementation of the `checkPerfectNumber` method in the `Solution` class adheres to the given requirements and ensures that the code is robust, fault-tolerant, and handles edge cases appropriately.", "final_score": 24.666666666666668}

The `connectAndSubscribe` method takes the MQTT broker URL, client ID, topic, and quality of service (QoS) as parameters.\n2. Inside the method, an MQTT client is created using the `MqttClient` class from the Eclipse Paho library.\n3. The callback methods for connection lost, message arrival, and delivery completion are set using the `setCallback` method.\n4. A connection to the MQTT broker is established using the `connect` method with the `MqttConnectOptions` class.\n5. The client subscribes to the specified topic with the given QoS using the `subscribe` method.\n6. If any errors occur during the connection or subscription process, they are caught and printed to the console.\n7. The `disconnect` method is used to disconnect the MQTT client from the broker, if it is currently connected.\n\nTo use the `MqttSubscriber` class, you can create an instance of it and call the `connectAndSubscribe` method with the appropriate parameters. For example:\n\n```java\nMqttSubscriber subscriber = new MqttSubscriber();\nsubscriber.connectAndSubscribe(\"tcp://broker.example.com:1883\", \"client-id\", \"topic/example\", 0);\n```\n\nThis will connect the MQTT client to the broker at `tcp://broker.example.com:1883`, subscribe to the `topic/example` topic with QoS 0, and start receiving messages. When you're done, you can call the `disconnect` method to disconnect from the broker.", "final_score": 23.666666666666668}

If it does, a suffix is appended, and the counter is incremented until a unique directory name is found.\n5. **Directory Creation**: The `os.makedirs` function is used to create the directory; it will not throw an error if the directory already exists due to the prior checks.\n6. **Return Value**: The function returns a list of the full paths of the created directories.\n\nThis solution ensures that the directory creation process is robust, handles existing directories gracefully, and provides clear paths for the created directories.", "final_score": 27.0}

If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the method returns `false`, indicating that no duplicates were found in the array.\n\nThis solution has an efficient time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

This graph represents the dependencies between the migrations, where the keys are the dependencies, and the values are the list of migrations that depend on them.\n\n2. **Perform a Topological Sort**: We then perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the dependency graph to obtain the topological order of the migrations. The `dfs` function recursively visits each migration, marking them as visited and adding them to the `stack` in the order they are finished.\n\n3. **Reverse the Stack**: Finally, we reverse the `stack` to get the final order in which the migrations should be applied, as the topological sort produces the order in reverse.\n\nThis implementation handles circular dependencies by detecting them during the DFS traversal. If a circular dependency is encountered, the function will raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating the circular dependency.\n\nAdditionally, the function handles missing dependencies by simply ignoring them during the topological sort.

Your task is to complete the implementation by writing a function to detect corners using the Harris corner detection algorithm.\n\nYour function signature should be:\n```python\ndef detect_corners(image):\n    # Your implementation here\n    pass\n```", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-1", "answer": "Here's the implementation of the `detect_corners` function using the Harris corner detection algorithm in Python with OpenCV:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef detect_corners(image):\n    try:\n        # Convert the image to grayscale and float32 format\n        gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n        gray = np.float32(gray)\n\n        # Apply the Harris corner detection algorithm\n        dst = cv2.cornerHarris(gray, blockSize=2, ksize=3, k=0.04)\n\n        # Dilate the result to enhance the corners\n        dst = cv2.dilate(dst, None)\n\n        # Threshold the result to obtain the corner coordinates\n        threshold = 0.01 * dst.max()\n        corners = np.where(dst > threshold)\n\n        # Return the coordinates of the detected corners\n        return list(zip(corners[1], corners[0]))\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error occurred during corner detection: {e}\")\n        return []\n```\n\nHere's how the code works:\n\n1. The function takes a grayscale image as input.\n2. It converts the image to grayscale and float32 format, as required by the Harris corner detection algorithm.\n3. The `cv2.cornerHarris()` function is used to apply the Harris corner detection algorithm to the grayscale image. This function returns a response map indicating the strength of the corners.\n4. The response map is then dilated using `cv2.dilate()` to enhance the corners.\n5. A threshold is applied to the dilated response map to obtain the coordinates of the detected corners.\n6. The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the (x, y) coordinates of a detected corner.\n\nThe code also includes exception handling to capture any errors that may occur during the corner detection process. If an exception is raised, the function will print an error message and return an empty list.\n\nYou can use this `detect_corners` function as follows:\n\n```python\nfilename = 'image.jpg'\nimg = cv2.imread(filename)\nimg = cv2.resize(img, (640, 480), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)\ncorners = detect_corners(img)\n\n# Draw the detected corners on the image\nfor corner in corners:\n    x, y = corner\n    cv2.circle(img, (x, y), 5, (0, 0, 255), -1)\n\ncv2.imshow('Corners', img)\ncv2.waitKey(0)\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\nThis code will load the image, detect the corners using the `detect_corners` function, and then draw the detected corners on the image. The resulting image will be displayed using OpenCV's `cv2.imshow()` function.", "final_score": 22.333333333333332}

Your task is to implement the `Callback` class and its associated methods to achieve the desired functionality.\n\nYour `Callback` class should have the following public methods:\n1. `registerCallback`: This method should take a function pointer or a lambda function and register it as a callback.\n2. `invokeCallbacks`: This method should be thread-safe and should invoke all the registered callbacks.\n\nYour implementation should ensure that the `invokeCallbacks` method can be safely called from multiple threads without causing data races or other synchronization issues.\n\nYour task is to complete the implementation of the `Callback` class and its methods to achieve the desired functionality.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <functional>\n#include <omp.h>\n\nclass Callback {\npublic:\n    void registerCallback(std::function<void()> callback) {\n        // TODO: Implement callback registration\n    }\n\n    void invokeCallbacks() {\n        // TODO: Implement thread-safe invocation of registered callbacks\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Callback callback;\n\n    // Registering callbacks\n    callback.registerCallback([]() { std::cout << \"Callback 1 invoked\" << std::endl; });\n    callback.registerCallback([]() { std::cout << \"Callback 2 invoked\" << std::endl; });\n\n    // Simulating parallel processing\n    int i = 0;\n    omp_set_num_threads(2);\n#pragma omp parallel for\n    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        // Invoke callbacks within the parallel loop\n        callback.invokeCallbacks();\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```", "generation_model": "deepseek-chat-2", "answer": "To implement the `Callback` class with thread-safe callback registration and invocation, we need to ensure that the `registerCallback` and `invokeCallbacks` methods are synchronized to prevent data races. We can achieve this by using a mutex to protect the shared resource (the vector of callbacks).\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <functional>\n#include <omp.h>\n#include <mutex>\n\nclass Callback {\npublic:\n    void registerCallback(std::function<void()> callback) {\n        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);\n        callbacks_.push_back(callback);\n    }\n\n    void invokeCallbacks() {\n        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);\n        for (const auto& callback : callbacks_) {\n            callback();\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::vector<std::function<void()>> callbacks_;\n    std::mutex mutex_;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Callback callback;\n\n    // Registering callbacks\n    callback.registerCallback([]() { std::cout << \"Callback 1 invoked\" << std::endl; });\n    callback.registerCallback([]() { std::cout << \"Callback 2 invoked\" << std::endl; });\n\n    // Simulating parallel processing\n    int i = 0;\n    omp_set_num_threads(2);\n#pragma omp parallel for\n    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        // Invoke callbacks within the parallel loop\n        callback.invokeCallbacks();\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Mutex for Synchronization**:\n   - We use a `std::mutex` named `mutex_` to protect the `callbacks_` vector. This ensures that only one thread can modify or access the vector at a time, preventing data races.\n\n2. **registerCallback Method**:\n   - The `registerCallback` method locks the mutex using `std::lock_guard` to ensure that the registration of a new callback is thread-safe. The new callback is then added to the `callbacks_` vector.\n\n3. **invokeCallbacks Method**:\n   - The `invokeCallbacks` method also locks the mutex using `std::lock_guard` to ensure that the invocation of callbacks is thread-safe. It then iterates over the `callbacks_` vector and invokes each callback.\n\n4. **Parallel Processing**:\n   - In the `main` function, we use OpenMP to create a parallel loop that invokes the callbacks. The `invokeCallbacks` method is called within the parallel loop, and the mutex ensures that the callbacks are invoked safely across multiple threads.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the `Callback` class is thread-safe and can handle concurrent registration and invocation of callbacks without causing data races or other synchronization issues.", "final_score": 28.333333333333332}

Deserialize the configuration data from a file.\n\nThe `ConfigManager` class should have the following methods:\n- `void setConfig(String key, Serializable value)`: Stores the given key-value pair in the configuration.\n- `Serializable getConfig(String key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the given key.\n- `void serializeConfig(String filePath)`: Serializes the configuration data to the specified file.\n- `void deserializeConfig(String filePath)`: Deserializes the configuration data from the specified file.\n\nYou should use a `HashMap` to store the key-value pairs in the configuration.", "generation_model": "gpt-4o-mini-1", "answer": "Here is a complete and executable Java code snippet for the `ConfigManager` class that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class ConfigManager {\n    private final Map<String, Serializable> configMap;\n\n    public ConfigManager() {\n        this.configMap = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public void setConfig(String key, Serializable value) {\n        if (key == null || value == null) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Key and value must not be null.\");\n        }\n        configMap.put(key, value);\n    }\n\n    public Serializable getConfig(String key) {\n        if (key == null) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Key must not be null.\");\n        }\n        return configMap.get(key);\n    }\n\n    public void serializeConfig(String filePath) {\n        try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(filePath))) {\n            oos.writeObject(configMap);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"Error serializing configuration data: \" + e.getMessage(), e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void deserializeConfig(String filePath) {\n        try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(filePath))) {\n            // Cast is safe since we know the type of data we are working with\n            @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n            Map<String, Serializable> deserializedMap = (Map<String, Serializable>) ois.readObject();\n            configMap.clear();\n            configMap.putAll(deserializedMap);\n        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"Error deserializing configuration data: \" + e.getMessage(), e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        ConfigManager configManager = new ConfigManager();\n        configManager.setConfig(\"username\", \"admin\");\n        configManager.setConfig(\"timeout\", 30);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Username: \" + configManager.getConfig(\"username\"));\n        System.out.println(\"Timeout: \" + configManager.getConfig(\"timeout\"));\n\n        // Serialize to a file\n        configManager.serializeConfig(\"config.dat\");\n\n        // Clear current configuration and deserialize from file\n        configManager.deserializeConfig(\"config.dat\");\n        System.out.println(\"Deserialized Username: \" + configManager.getConfig(\"username\"));\n        System.out.println(\"Deserialized Timeout: \" + configManager.getConfig(\"timeout\"));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Data Structure**: A `HashMap<String, Serializable>` is used to store the key-value pairs.\n2. **setConfig Method**: Stores a key-value pair and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the key or value is null.\n3. **getConfig Method**: Retrieves the value associated with the specified key and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the key is null.\n4. **serializeConfig Method**: Serializes the configuration data to a file specified by `filePath`. It handles `IOException` and wraps it in a `RuntimeException` for clarity.\n5. **deserializeConfig Method**: Reads the configuration data from a file and populates the `configMap`. It handles both `IOException` and `ClassNotFoundException`.\n6. **Main Method**: Demonstrates the usage of the `ConfigManager` by setting configurations, serializing them, and deserializing them back.\n\n### Exception Handling:\n- The code includes exception handling to ensure that operations are robust and provide clear error messages when failures occur.", "final_score": 27.666666666666668}

Comprehensive error handling at multiple levels\n   - Logs errors without breaking the function execution\n   - Allows for flexible error management\n\n3. **Logging**:\n   - Configures a basic logging mechanism\n   - Logs function inputs, outputs, and potential errors\n   - Uses Python's built-in `logging` module for structured logging\n\n4. **Quota Change Request**:\n   - Simulates a quota change request method\n   - Includes basic validation\n   - Handles potential errors during the quota change process\n\n5. **Flexibility**:\n   - Works with both admin and non-admin requests\n   - Allows conditional logging and quota change requests\n   -

The `example_usage()` function demonstrates how to use the class and handle potential exceptions.\n\nTo use this class, you would typically:\n1. Create an instance of `JsonVariableManager`\n2. Load a JSON file\n3. Retrieve or update variables\n4. Save the modified file\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the implementation?", "final_score": 29.0}

We create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount `i`.\n- **Base Case**: `dp[0]` is initialized to `0` because no coins are needed to make up the amount `0`.\n- **Iterative Calculation**: For each amount from `1` to `amount`, we iterate through all the coin denominations. If the coin value is less than or equal to the current amount, we check if using this coin leads to a better solution (i.e., fewer coins). If so, we update `dp[i]`.\n- **Final Check**: After filling the `dp` array, we check if `dp[amount]` is still `INT_MAX`. If it is, it means it's not possible to make up the amount with the given coins, so we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return `dp[amount]`.\n\n### Robustness Considerations:\n- **Exception Handling**: The function handles cases where the amount cannot be made up by returning `-1`. This ensures that the function does not crash or return incorrect results in such scenarios.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: The function handles edge cases such as `amount = 0` and cases where no combination of coins can make up the amount.\n- **Resource Management**: The function uses a fixed-size vector for `dp`, so there is no risk of memory leaks or excessive memory usage.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and robust, ensuring that it works correctly under various conditions.", "final_score": 20.0}

Minimal memory footprint with in-memory dictionary generation\n\nThe code provides a robust solution that can handle various input scenarios while maintaining clean, efficient, and error-resistant processing of database migration operations.\n\nNote: The code assumes the use of Django's migration framework.

The resulting `Range` object is adjusted to ensure that the left boundary is the minimum of `tmp.left` and 0, and the right boundary is the maximum of `tmp.right` and 0. Finally, a new `Range` object is returned with these adjusted values.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the provided example `args = [5, -3, 10]`, the output will be:\n```\nRange: left=-3, right=5\n```\n\nThis code is robust, handles boundary conditions, and ensures proper resource management.", "final_score": 18.666666666666668}

The `process_file` function takes a file path as input and performs the following steps:\n   - It uses a `with` statement to open the file for reading. This ensures that the file is properly closed after the block is executed, even if an exception occurs.\n   - If the file is successfully opened, the function reads the contents of the file and passes them to the `process_data` function (which is a placeholder for the actual file processing logic).\n   - If the file is not found, the function raises a `FileProcessingException` with the message \"File not found\".\n   - If any other exception occurs during the file processing, the function raises a `FileProcessingException` with the message \"Error processing file\".\n   - If the file is processed successfully, the function returns a success message.\n\n3. The `process_data` function is a placeholder for the actual file processing logic. In this example, it simply converts the input data to uppercase, but you can replace this with your own processing logic.\n\nYou can use the `process_file` function like this:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    result = process_file('example.txt')\n    print(result)\nexcept FileProcessingException as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nIf the file 'example.txt' is found and processed successfully, the output will be:\n\n```\nFile processed successfully\n```\n\nIf the file is not found, the output will be:\n\n```\nFile not found\n```\n\nIf an error occurs during the file processing, the output will be:\n\n```\nError processing file\n```\n\nThis custom exception handling mechanism allows you to provide more meaningful error messages and handle file processing failures in a more structured and informative way.", "final_score": 26.0}

The function creates a socket object using `socket.socket()` with the `socket.AF_INET` address family (for IPv4) and `socket.SOCK_STREAM` socket type (for TCP).\n2. The `setsockopt()` method is used to set the socket option `SO_REUSEADDR` to `1`, which enables address reuse. This allows the server to bind to the same address and port even if the socket is in a `TIME_WAIT` state.\n3. The `bind()` method is used to bind the socket to the specified `address` and `port`.\n4. The `listen()` method is called to make the server socket start listening for incoming connections, with a backlog of 1 (the maximum number of queued connections).\n5. A message is printed to indicate that the server is listening on the specified address and port.\n6. The `accept()` method is called to wait for a client connection. When a client connects, the server prints a message indicating the client's address.\n7. The `close()` method is called to close the client connection.\n\nThis implementation sets up a simple server that listens on the specified address and port, with the socket option for address reuse enabled.

When a connection is accepted, the server prints the client's address and then closes the connection.\n6. **Graceful Shutdown**: The server can be shut down gracefully using `Ctrl+C`, which triggers a `KeyboardInterrupt`. The server socket is closed in the `finally` block to ensure resources are released properly.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the server is robust, handles connections gracefully, and can be shut down without leaving resources dangling.", "final_score": 16.333333333333332}

The function `process_input` takes a string `input_str` as input.\n2. The function initializes an empty dictionary `result` to store the output.\n3. The function uses a try-except block to handle potential exceptions.\n4. If the input string is empty, the function sets the \"code\" key to 400 and the \"msg\" key to \"Empty input string\".\n5. If the input string is not empty, the function tries to convert it to an integer. If successful, it sets the \"input_type\" key to \"integer\".\n6. If the input string cannot be converted to an integer, the function tries to convert it to a float. If successful, it sets the \"input_type\" key to \"float\".\n7. If the input string cannot be converted to either an integer or a float, the function sets the \"input_type\" key to \"string\".\n8. If any exception occurs during the processing of the input string, the function sets the \"code\" key to 401 and the \"msg\" key to the string representation of the exception.\n9. Finally, the function returns the `result` dictionary.\n\nThe function handles the following cases:\n- If the input string is a valid integer, it returns a dictionary with the \"input_type\" key set to \"integer\".\n- If the input string is a valid float, it returns a dictionary with the \"input_type\" key set to \"float\".\n- If the input string is neither a valid integer nor a valid float, it returns a dictionary with the \"input_type\" key set to \"string\".\n- If the input string is empty, it returns a dictionary with the \"code\" key set to 400 and the \"msg\" key set to \"Empty input string\".\n- If an exception occurs during the processing of the input string, it returns a dictionary with the \"code\" key set to 401 and the \"msg\" key set to the string representation of the exception.", "final_score": 27.333333333333332}

Display the following fields for each plugin: Name, Author, Description, and Installed status.\n\nYour task is to complete the `Apps` function to achieve the above requirements.", "generation_model": "deepseek-chat-2", "answer": "Here is the complete and executable code snippet for the `Apps` view function in a Django web application:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\nfrom .models import Plugin  # Assuming you have a Plugin model defined\n\ndef Apps(request):\n    try:\n        # Retrieve a list of installed plugins from the database\n        plugins = Plugin.objects.filter(installed=True)  # Filter only installed plugins\n        \n        # Prepare the context to pass to the template\n        context = {\n            'plugins': plugins,\n        }\n        \n        # Render the list of plugins in a web page using a template\n        return render(request, 'apps.html', context)\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle exceptions gracefully and provide a meaningful error message\n        error_message = f\"An error occurred while retrieving the list of plugins: {str(e)}\"\n        return HttpResponse(error_message, status=500)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Retrieve Installed Plugins**:\n   - The `Plugin.objects.filter(installed=True)` query retrieves all plugins from the database where the `installed` field is `True`.\n   - This assumes you have a `Plugin` model with fields like `name`, `author`, `description`, and `installed`.\n\n2. **Render the Template**:\n   - The `render` function is used to render the `apps.html` template with the `plugins` context.\n   - The `apps.html` template should iterate over the `plugins` context variable to display the `name`, `author`, `description`, and `installed` status for each plugin.\n\n3. **Exception Handling**:\n   - If an exception occurs (e.g., database connection issues), it is caught, and a meaningful error message is returned with an HTTP 500 status code.\n\n### Example `apps.html` Template:\nHere’s an example of what the `apps.html` template might look like:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Installed Plugins</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Installed Plugins</h1>\n    <table border=\"1\">\n        <thead>\n            <tr>\n                <th>Name</th>\n                <th>Author</th>\n                <th>Description</th>\n                <th>Installed</th>\n            </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n            {% for plugin in plugins %}\n            <tr>\n                <td>{{ plugin.name }}</td>\n                <td>{{ plugin.author }}</td>\n                <td>{{ plugin.description }}</td>\n                <td>{{ plugin.installed }}</td>\n            </tr>\n            {% endfor %}\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure the `Plugin` model is defined in your Django application with the required fields (`name`, `author`, `description`, `installed`).\n- The `apps.html` template should be placed in the appropriate directory (e.g., `templates/` in your app folder).\n- This code assumes that the `installed` field is a boolean field in the `Plugin` model. Adjust the query and template as needed based on your actual model structure.", "final_score": 18.0}

Additionally, you need to create a sample usage scenario to demonstrate the functionality of the debugging context holder.\n\nYour implementation should adhere to the following requirements:\n- Implement the `DebugContextHolder` interface with the `getDebugContext` method.\n- Create a concrete implementation of the `DebugContextHolder` interface.\n- Demonstrate the usage of the debugging context holder in a multi-threaded environment.\n\nYou can use the given code snippet as a reference for the interface definition and method signature.", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-1", "answer": "Here's the implementation of the `DebugContextHolder` interface and a sample usage scenario:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic interface DebugContextHolder {\n    Map<String, Object> getDebugContext();\n}\n\npublic class DebugContextHolderImpl implements DebugContextHolder {\n    private static final ThreadLocal<Map<String, Object>> debugContext = ThreadLocal.withInitial(HashMap::new);\n\n    @Override\n    public Map<String, Object> getDebugContext() {\n        return debugContext.get();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        DebugContextHolder debugContextHolder = new DebugContextHolderImpl();\n\n        // Set debug context in the main thread\n        Map<String, Object> context = debugContextHolder.getDebugContext();\n        context.put(\"userId\", 123);\n        context.put(\"requestId\", \"abc123\");\n\n        // Demonstrate usage in a multi-threaded environment\n        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {\n            Map<String, Object> thread1Context = debugContextHolder.getDebugContext();\n            thread1Context.put(\"userId\", 456);\n            thread1Context.put(\"requestId\", \"def456\");\n\n            // Access the debug context\n            System.out.println(\"Thread 1 Debug Context: \" + thread1Context);\n        });\n\n        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {\n            Map<String, Object> thread2Context = debugContextHolder.getDebugContext();\n            thread2Context.put(\"userId\", 789);\n            thread2Context.put(\"requestId\", \"ghi789\");\n\n            // Access the debug context\n            System.out.println(\"Thread 2 Debug Context: \" + thread2Context);\n        });\n\n        thread1.start();\n        thread2.start();\n\n        try {\n            thread1.join();\n            thread2.join();\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        // Access the debug context in the main thread\n        System.out.println(\"Main Thread Debug Context: \" + context);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `DebugContextHolderImpl` class implements the `DebugContextHolder` interface and uses a `ThreadLocal` variable to store the debugging context. The `getDebugContext` method retrieves the debugging context associated with the current thread.\n\nThe `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `DebugContextHolder` in a multi-threaded environment. It sets the debugging context in the main thread, creates two additional threads, and sets the debugging context in each of those threads. Finally, it accesses the debugging context in the main thread and the two child threads, demonstrating that the debugging context is isolated for each thread.\n\nWhen you run the `main` method, the output will be similar to the following:\n\n```\nThread 1 Debug Context: {userId=456, requestId=def456}\nThread 2 Debug Context: {userId=789, requestId=ghi789}\nMain Thread Debug Context: {userId=123, requestId=abc123}\n```\n\nThis demonstrates that the debugging context is correctly isolated and maintained for each thread, allowing you to store and retrieve context-specific information as needed.", "final_score": 28.666666666666668}

The `RembThrottler` class is defined, which takes a `sender_function` and a `clock_reference` as input parameters.\n2. The class maintains the following attributes:\n   - `current_rate`: The current sending rate.\n   - `target_rate`: The target sending rate based on the network feedback.\n   - `alpha`: The exponential moving average smoothing factor (between 0 and 1).\n   - `last_update_time`: The timestamp of the last rate update.\n3. The `receive_feedback` method is used to update the `target_rate` based on the network feedback.\n4. The `update_rate` method is responsible for calculating the new `current_rate` using an exponential moving average, and then calling the `sender_function` to adjust the sending rate.\n5. The `run` method simulates the feedback loop by periodically receiving network feedback and updating the sending rate.\n6. The `calculate_feedback` method simulates the network feedback calculation, which in this case is a sine wave.\n7. In the example usage, the `sender_function` is defined, which simply prints the data sending rate.\n8. An instance of the `RembThrottler` class is created, and the `run` method is called to start the throttling loop.\n\nThe REMB throttler implementation handles the following requirements:\n\n1. **Exception Handling**: The provided code does not include any explicit exception handling, but it can be easily added to handle potential issues, such as errors in the `sender_function` or the `clock_reference`.\n2. **Boundary Conditions and Special Cases Handling**: The code assumes that the network feedback is a valid numerical value. Additional checks can be added to handle special cases, such as `None` or invalid feedback values.\n3. **Fault Tolerance**: The REMB throttler is designed to continuously adjust the sending rate based on the network feedback, which provides a certain level of fault tolerance. However, more advanced recovery mechanisms can be added to handle cases where the feedback loop is disrupted or the network conditions change rapidly.\n4. **Resource Management**: The provided code does not require any explicit resource management, as it does not use any external resources. However, if the `sender_function` or the `clock_reference` require resource management, it should be handled appropriately.", "final_score": 14.0}

{"index": 8815, "programming_language": "python", "code-instruction": "You are tasked with implementing a Python function that processes a given URI and extracts specific components from it. The URI follows the format `ccnx:/<component1>/<component2>/.../<componentN>`, where each `<component>` is a string without any special characters. Your task is to write a function `extract_uri_components(uri)` that takes a URI as input and returns a list containing the individual components extracted from the URI.\n\nFor example, given the input URI `ccnx:/apple/banana/cherry/durian`, the function should return `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'durian']`.\n\nWrite the `extract_uri_components(uri)` function to solve this problem.", "generation_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2", "answer": "Here is a robust implementation of the `extract_uri_components(uri)` function that processes the given URI and extracts the components while handling potential errors and edge cases:\n\n```python\ndef extract_uri_components(uri):\n    # Validate the input\n    if not isinstance(uri, str):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a string.\")\n\n    # Check if the URI starts with the expected prefix\n    if not uri.startswith(\"ccnx:/\"):\n        raise ValueError(\"URI must start with 'ccnx:/'.\")\n\n    # Remove the prefix and split the URI into components\n    components = uri[6:].split('/')\n\n    # Filter out empty components (might occur if there are trailing slashes)\n    components = [comp for comp in components if comp]\n\n    # Check for validity of each component\n    for component in components:\n        if not component.isalnum():  # Check that component contains only alphanumeric characters\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid component '{component}': Only alphanumeric characters are allowed.\")\n\n    return components\n\n# Example usage:\ntry:\n    result = extract_uri_components(\"ccnx:/apple/banana/cherry/durian\")\n    print(result)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'durian']\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if the input is a string and whether it starts with the correct prefix `ccnx:/`.

The resulting list is filtered to remove any empty components that might be caused by trailing slashes.\n\n3. **Component Validation**: Each component is checked to ensure it contains only alphanumeric characters. If any component is invalid, a `ValueError` is raised with a clear message.\n\n4. **Return Value**: The function returns the list of valid components extracted from the URI.\n\nThis implementation is designed to be robust, handling various edge cases and ensuring that any issues with the input are clearly communicated through exceptions.", "final_score": 27.666666666666668}

If it is, we return `0` since there are no characters to form a subsequence.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will hold the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.\n3. **Initialization**: We initialize the diagonal of the `dp` table with `1` because each character in the string is a palindrome of length `1`.\n4. **Filling the DP Table**: We iterate over all possible substring lengths and fill in the `dp` table:\n    - If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same, we can extend the palindromic subsequence by these two characters and add `2` to the value of `dp[i+1][j-1]`.\n    - If the characters are different, we take the maximum length from either the left or right substring.\n5. **Result**: Finally, the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string is found at `dp[0][n-1]`.\n\n### Robustness Aspects:\n- **Exception Handling**: The function checks for an empty input and handles it gracefully.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: The algorithm properly initializes and handles palindromic subsequences of different lengths.\n- **Resource Management**: Memory is managed through the use of a 2D list, which is cleaned up when it goes out of scope after the function execution.\n\nThis implementation ensures that we can efficiently find the longest palindromic subsequence while maintaining robustness against edge cases.", "final_score": 23.0}

The x and y coordinates are floating-point numbers.\n\n**Output:**\n- The function should return a tuple of two tuples, where the first tuple represents the pair of points with the maximum distance between them.\n\n**Note:**\n- The Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\npoints = [(-0.0697622150950153008986, 0.046432560482317929183),\n          (-0.0232708715407507060344, 0.0465333413404968638234),\n          (0.02327087154075070603437, 0.0465333413404968638234),\n          (0.0697622150950153008986, 0.0464325604823179291833),\n          (0.1161024692216898182267, 0.046231217034791425205),\n          (0.1621912712463770264451, 0.0459297470628552269276),\n          (0.2079288030837679729796, 0.045528803483127572753),\n          (0.2532160074213070237007, 0.0450292546498245100301),\n          (0.2979548022551796483432, 0.0444321824740826399099),\n          (0.3420482933139803129623, 0.043738880080758951608),\n          (0.3854009839099910183841, 0.0429508490077806243141),\n          (0.4279189817635698486723, 0.042069795954107501617),\n          (0.4695102023527009595653, 0.0410976290833462117396)]\n\nmax_distance_points(points)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n((0.4695102023527009595653, 0.0410976290833462117396), (-0.0697622150950153008986, 0.046432560482317929183))\n```", "generation_model": "gpt-4o-mini-1", "answer": "Here is the implementation of the `max_distance_points` function that calculates the Euclidean distance between each pair of points and returns the pair of points with the maximum distance between them.

A primitive string is a balanced parentheses string that cannot be split into smaller balanced parentheses strings. The approach involves identifying these primitive strings and then stripping their outermost parentheses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Primitive Strings**: We can use a counter to keep track of the balance of parentheses. Whenever the counter increments to 1, it signifies the start of a primitive string. When the counter decrements to 0, it signifies the end of a primitive string.\n2. **Process Each Primitive String**: For each identified primitive string, we exclude the first and last parentheses (the outermost ones) and include the rest in the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef removeOuterParentheses(s: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    balance = 0\n    start = 0\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char == '(':\n            balance += 1\n        else:\n            balance -= 1\n        if balance == 0:\n            result.append(s[start+1:i])\n            start = i + 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` to collect the processed strings, a `balance` counter to track the parentheses balance, and a `start` index to mark the beginning of each primitive string.\n2. **Iterate Through the String**: For each character in the string:\n   - If the character is '(', increment the balance.\n   - If the character is ')', decrement the balance.\n3. **Check for Primitive String**: Whenever the balance returns to 0, it means we have found a complete primitive string from `start` to the current index `i`. The primitive string's content without the outermost parentheses is from `start+1` to `i-1`, which we append to `result`.\n4. **Update Start Index**: After processing each primitive string, update the `start` index to `i+1` to begin processing the next primitive string.\n5. **Return Result**: Join all the processed strings in `result` and return the concatenated string.\n\nThis approach efficiently breaks down the input string into primitive strings, processes each by removing the outermost parentheses, and combines the results into the desired output.

This prevents errors during execution and ensures the function is robust against invalid inputs.\n\n2. **Sorting Mechanism**: A dictionary `sorting_key` maps each value in `sorted_list` to its index. The dictionary items are then sorted based on this mapping using a lambda function. If a key is not found in `sorted_list`, it defaults to a large number (`float('inf')`), ensuring that those keys are sorted to the end.\n\n3. **YAML Serialization**: The sorted dictionary is serialized into YAML format using the `yaml.dump()` method. The custom dumper `MyDumper` allows for specific settings, such as avoiding key sorting and allowing Unicode characters.\n\n4. **Example Usage**: The provided example demonstrates how to use the `custom_sort_and_serialize` function with a sample dictionary and sorting list.

The `on_message` callback processes incoming messages.\n\n3. **Message Processing**: The `on_message` function decodes the message payload, parses it as JSON, and extracts the device ID and location coordinates. It performs checks to ensure that the message format is valid and logs appropriate messages based on the processing outcome.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The function employs robust error handling to deal with JSON decoding errors and any other exceptions that may arise during message processing or MQTT connection.\n\n5. **Resource Management**: The MQTT loop is started using `loop_start()` to handle incoming messages asynchronously, ensuring that the client remains responsive and connected.\n\n6. **Logging**: Logging at different levels (info, warning, error) is used to provide insights into the functioning of the tracker and help diagnose issues if they arise. \n\nMake sure to replace `\"mqtt_broker_url\"` with the actual URL of your MQTT broker for the code to function correctly.", "final_score": 26.0}

If the server fails to start or accept a connection, it logs an error message and exits gracefully.\n2. **Connection Loop**: The server runs in an infinite loop, continuously accepting connections from clients.\n3. **Resource Management**: After sending the welcome message, the server disconnects the client properly to free up resources.\n4. **Message Sending**: The server sends a null-terminated message by using `message.length() + 1` to ensure that the entire string is sent, including the terminating null character.\n\nTo test this server, you can create a corresponding client program similar to the provided snippet, ensuring it connects to the server and receives the welcome message correctly. \n\n### Client Code:\nThe client code provided in the original question can remain as is.

If so, the particle becomes part of the aggregate.\n3. **Visualization**: The `visualize_aggregation` function uses `matplotlib` to visualize the grid where the aggregation occurs.\n4. **Main Function**: Coordinates the simulation and visualization, allowing input for grid size, number of particles, and visualization speed.\n\n### Note:\nTo run this code, ensure you have the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries installed. You can install them using pip if needed:\n\n```bash\npip install numpy matplotlib\n``` \n\nThis code will display the aggregation process in a window, showing how particles accumulate to form a structure over time.

This method also supports passing additional arguments to the target function.\n\n3. **Stopping Threads**: The `stop` method sets the `stop_event`, signaling all threads to finish their work. It waits for each thread to complete using `join()` before clearing the list of threads.\n\n4. **Worker Method**: The `worker` method simulates a task done by a thread. It checks the `stop_event` periodically to know when to stop processing.\n\n5. **Usage**: In the example usage, we create a `Server` instance, add a few threads, and allow them to run for a short period. The server can be stopped gracefully, either by the timeout or a keyboard interrupt.\n\nThis implementation ensures that resources are managed properly, threads can be stopped gracefully, and any potential exceptions (like thread errors) can be handled as needed.", "final_score": 26.333333333333332}

The properties to be counted are:\n1. `num_kernel`: The total number of masks in the generator's state dictionary.\n2. `zero_kernel`: The number of masks with all elements being zero.\n3. `n_kernel`: The number of masks with a non-zero number of elements.\n\nFor example, given the following code snippet:\n```python\ncheckpoint = {\n    'gen_state_dict': {\n        'mask1': torch.tensor([0, 0, 0, 0]),\n        'mask2': torch.tensor([1, 0, 1, 0]),\n        'mask3': torch.tensor([0, 0, 0, 0]),\n        'mask4': torch.tensor([1, 1, 1, 1]),\n        'mask5': torch.tensor([0, 1, 0, 1])\n    }\n}\n```\nThe function `process_checkpoint(checkpoint)` should return `(5, 2, 3)` indicating that there are 5 masks in total, 2 masks with all elements being zero, and 3 masks with a non-zero number of elements.", "generation_model": "claude-3-haiku-1", "answer": "Here's a comprehensive solution that addresses the requirements:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef process_checkpoint(checkpoint: dict) -> (int, int, int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Process neural network checkpoint and extract mask information.\n    \n    Args:\n        checkpoint (dict): Checkpoint dictionary containing generator state dict\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: (total masks, zero masks, non-zero masks)\n    \n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If checkpoint or gen_state_dict is invalid\n        TypeError: If input is not a dictionary or masks are not tensors\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Validate input checkpoint\n        if not isinstance(checkpoint, dict):\n            raise TypeError(\"Checkpoint must be a dictionary\")\n        \n        # Check if gen_state_dict exists\n        if 'gen_state_dict' not in checkpoint:\n            raise ValueError(\"Checkpoint missing 'gen_state_dict'\")\n        \n        gen_state_dict = checkpoint['gen_state_dict']\n        \n        # Initialize counters\n        num_kernel = 0  # Total number of masks\n        zero_kernel = 0  # Masks with all zero elements\n        n_kernel = 0    # Masks with non-zero elements\n        \n        # Iterate through masks in generator state dict\n        for mask_name, mask_tensor in gen_state_dict.items():\n            # Validate mask is a tensor\n            if not isinstance(mask_tensor, torch.Tensor):\n                raise TypeError(f\"Mask {mask_name} is not a torch tensor\")\n            \n            # Count total masks\n            num_kernel += 1\n            \n            # Check if mask is all zeros\n            if torch.all(mask_tensor == 0):\n                zero_kernel += 1\n            else:\n                n_kernel += 1\n        \n        return (num_kernel, zero_kernel, n_kernel)\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        # Log the error and re-raise with context\n        print(f\"Error processing checkpoint: {str(e)}\")\n        raise\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a robust solution with the following key features:\n\n1. **Exception Handling**:\n   - Captures and handles potential errors\n   - Provides clear, informative error messages\n   - Validates input types and structure\n   - Logs errors before re-raising exceptions\n\n2. **Boundary Conditions and Special Cases Handling**:\n   - Checks for invalid input types\n   - Validates presence of required dictionary keys\n   - Handles different tensor configurations\n   - Ensures robust processing of masks\n\n3. **Fault Tolerance**:\n   - Can handle various input scenarios\n   - Provides graceful error recovery\n   - Prevents system crashes through comprehensive error checking\n\n4. **Resource Management**:\n   - Minimal memory usage\n   - No unnecessary resource allocation\n   - Efficient iteration and counting\n\n5. **Type Hints and Docstrings**:\n   - Provides clear function signature\n   - Includes comprehensive documentation\n   - Enhances code readability and maintainability\n\nExample usage:\n```python\ncheckpoint = {\n    'gen_state_dict': {\n        'mask1': torch.tensor([0, 0, 0, 0]),\n        'mask2': torch.tensor([1, 0, 1, 0]),\n        'mask3': torch.tensor([0, 0, 0, 0]),\n        'mask4': torch.tensor([1, 1, 1, 1]),\n        'mask5': torch.tensor([0, 1, 0, 1])\n    }\n}\n\nresult = process_checkpoint(checkpoint)\nprint(result)  # Output: (5, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Counting total masks\n- Identifying zero masks\n- Tracking non-zero masks\n- Providing robust error handling\n- Supporting flexible input scenarios", "final_score": 30.0}
